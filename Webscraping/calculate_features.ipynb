       "'[\\'5I bought this one on a whim. I love stoats, especially spiced, coffee, and chocolate one, so i figured I’d give this one a try. I was so pleasantly surprised. This is truly one of the best beers I’ve ever had. And, it has a decent alcohol content as well. I like it when a single beer is enough to relax me. This one tastes like dessert. DEFINITELY TRY IT!Aug 15, 2021\\', \\'4.5Look: Dark liquid, like black coffee. Camel leather colored head that was short in height and slowly melted to a thin ring around the glass with moderate lacing.\\\\nSmell and Taste: Coffee and chocolate from the get go.\\\\nFeel: Slightly oily. Perfect amount of carbonation.\\\\nOverall: Excellent, well balanced stout.Aug 01, 2021\\', \\'4.5Founders Breakfast Stout is an amazing beer that luckily can be found widely.\\\\n\\\\nPoured from a bottle in a 4 pack into a traditional pint glass, the stout pours deep black with a slight umber cast around the margins. A head barely forms before disappearing to the edges creating a ring of light cream that lasted until around half way through the drink. The edge thins to create a dark umber ring as I tip the glass back for a drink. \\\\n\\\\nThe stout smells mainly of coffee and dark chocolate with slight hints of caramel and malt. The taste is supremely balanced which is why this beer is highly rated. Immediately the coffee and chocolate hit on the front. I was anticipating a bitter or alcohol taste (due to the higher than average alcohol content) when the flavor moved back but that never happened. The coffee, roast, and chocolate continued all the way through and left a slightly spiced aftertaste.\\\\n\\\\nThe stout feels medium thickness but not creamy due to its low carbonation. Swooshing the the beer in my mouth it does have a creamier feel as the little amount of carbonation in the beer comes out. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, this beer is packed with flavor and has nearly no negatives as long as one enjoys coffee and chocolate! The only thing that could potentially be better is a creamy head, but that may mess up the balance Founders has struck with this gem.Aug 01, 2021\\', \"4.512oz bottle fill date of 3/11/21 into a large snifter.\\\\nL: Pours very deep dark brown with a light ruby cast at it\\'s outer edges. It has a dark tan thin head that dissipates to edge foam. No visible carbonation. Some minimal spotty lacing.\\\\nS: Coffee, raisins, dark caramel, bourbon, chocolate, toffee.\\\\nT: Coffee, sweet chocolate, oak cask, raisins, oats, bitter chocolate, cinnamon, earthy char, burned coffee, charred bread crust.\\\\nF: It has a rich, lightly syrupy heavy mouthfeel with ample bitterness and a medium length finish. It does not go wide nor is it too dynamic. For the most part the mouthfeel is centralized.\\\\nO: A bittersweet oatmeal stout with profoundly deep columns of flavors. Poured, over time the beer has subtle changes in it\\'s taste which help lead to it\\'s overall deliciousness. A lovely portion of hops go elegantly with the char, coffee and sweet caramel. An incredible example in it\\'s style.Aug 01, 2021\", \"512 oz. Bottle poured into ale glass\\\\nLook: Two finger tan head, dark color like a cola, lots of carbonation. Lace stays. After half a glass, still retains a thin layer of foam...like an espresso.\\\\nSmell: Smell hit before the pour. Chocolate and coffee, like a chocolate covered coffee bean.\\\\nTaste: Hits with coffee first then dark chocolate follows. Bitterness as expected but not too bitter.\\\\nFeel: Coats the tongue, bubbles give nice tickle.\\\\nOverall: Not usually a stout fan but with the chocolate and coffee it is good. Don\\'t drink with food, enjoy alone with dips not gulps.Jul 04, 2021\", \"4.5Pours a dark, non-see-through, coffee/espresso with a moderate head that dissapates quickly but lingers on the glass. \\\\n\\\\nSmell is that of coffee, toffee, and malt.\\\\n\\\\nTaste is rich, full-bodied, and slightly sticky sweet with a bitterness that lingers on the palate for quite a while after each sip. Notes are similar to smell.. with coffee, dark chocolate and toffee at the helm. I\\'m not picking up on th oatmeal, but it could be because the other flavors are dominant. Alcohol is hidden well at 8.3%, but still noticeable.\\\\n\\\\nMouth feel is full bodied and syrupy, but not sickeningly so. \\\\n\\\\nDefinitely drinking this one slowly. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'m really enjoying this stout. Flavors are all balanced nicely. Because it\\'s so heavy, though, this is one for enjoying on special occasions or as a meal replacement (jk) .\\\\nWould definitely recommend this one.Jun 20, 2021\", \"4Bottled 3/11/21. This is the perfect time for a summer spring winter beer.\\\\n\\\\nThe description on the back of the bottle pretty much tells it all. It pours dark brown with a small tan head, much like the coffee types it emulates. Smell and taste are almost identical: black coffee and unsweetened chocolate. There is a bit of mild oat sweetness that I get on the nose, but not on the tongue. The chocolate is a bit more pronounced in the taste. There is a particular roasted quality in the aftertaste that I like. It\\'s a cup of joe that makes you feel even better. It\\'s very smooth, which may be attributed to the addition of oatmeal (I\\'m just reading BA\\'s description of the style at this point). No alcohol heat either.\\\\n\\\\nI enjoy it, even if it is a bit on the bitter side. There just isn\\'t anything that really grabs me.Jun 19, 2021\", \"4.5From a bottle to a glass\\\\n\\\\nL: looks an amazing dark brown with a 1 inch caramel colored head which turns into great lacing almost immediately\\\\n\\\\nS: strong coffee aromas with sweet caramel undertones. This beer doesn\\'t make you search for the smells\\\\n\\\\nT: as advertised, this beer is bitter from the coffee and sweet from the caramel. If you have ever tasted a riesen candy, it tastes identical to that. Somewhat bitter, but the sweetness lingers on your pallet.\\\\n\\\\nF: it has the feel.of an 8.3% beer and I could only have 1 or 2\\\\n\\\\nO: a super tasty beer, but be careful...it\\'ll sneak up on you. Overall, a great stoutMay 31, 2021\", \\'4.25finally time for me to chip in my opinion on this website’s most reviewed beer. I actually got this beer unintentionally, i had bought a bottle of founder’s porter from mchugh’s in kilbarrack, but they were out of stock and sent me this instead, quite the upgrade indeed. this beer is very tasty, pours black as night, tan coloured head with quite good retention, big nose, lot of coffee and chocolate, this beer is super coffee forward, ground coffee beans, espresso, earthy, roasty toasty flavour, burned bread, milk and dark chocolate, nice balance between sweet and bitter flavours, body is creamy and light for a strong stout like this, but still medium to full bodied, some alcohol warming, a very nice stout from a very good brewery.May 26, 2021\\', \\'4.75Pours jet black with a thick light brown head. \\\\nSmells immediately of rich coffee with lots of chocolate and a little tobacco. \\\\nBold chocolate flavor with plenty of roasted malt. Slightly bitter finish and the coffee comes strong in the aftertaste. \\\\nThis is a smooth well balanced delicious beer. Where is the 8.3% hiding. This is not my first and definitely not my last time drinking this world class stout.May 18, 2021\\', \\'3.25A decent stout that I forgot to log when I drank it. I could get the coffee and chocolate but it still lacked the thickness that I was looking for. At 8.2 ABV it still lacked the punch that I was looking for.Apr 26, 2021\\', \\'4Definitely has a raisin type smell. The flavor follows suit but you can distinguish the chocolate initially and the coffee on the backend. I like this beer but it’s not as complex as some of the other Founders which some may appreciate but I for one enjoy the mirage of flavors. Not a bad beer, just simple. Maybe if I had tried this before I tried so many of the other breakfast stout variants, I would have a different opinion.Apr 24, 2021\\', \"4.75Previously consumed and often, this review will be perfunctory. It\\'s undeniably one of the best in the world. Out from the 12 ounce bottle into a clear Imperial pint glass, it\\'s a richly deep and dark brown with a modest tan head. The roasted malt, chocolate and oat aroma can\\'t be surpassed by any in this style. It just might be the smoothest and richest brew you can find. The taste overall is complexly bittersweet. There\\'s so much good going on, but the prominent flavors are roasted, not burnt nor overly roasted barley malt, then coffee, then chocolate. If that\\'s not enough for the taste buds to discern, there\\'s some sort of mild spiciness created by the infusion of the major contributors. An amazing mouthfeel for such an ABV, this may be the world\\'s best stout.Apr 10, 2021\", \"4.5Bottled 1\\'21, consumed 4\\'21. Poured into a tulip glass (cuz i like those). Intentionally foamed it a bit & beer responded w/ small/mid-sized head.\\\\nTaste: Coffee, no chocolate, no coffee, ... well choco-coffee it is, but medium to full, not at all like a sweet mocha-java. Just the echo of sweetness. Hops are perfect - you couldn\\'t enjoy this with too little and you couldn\\'t experience the choco-coffee with too much. Perfect balance. Zero booziness for a heavy ABV beer.\\\\nLook: cross between motor oil & espresso, but not as thick as the stuff left in the coffee pot for 3-4 hours.\\\\nOverall: Has to be one of my faves for cool weather beers. Can stand up to a cigar but also good alone. Must be awesome out of the tap; maybe worth a trip to Grand Rapids.Apr 04, 2021\", \\'4Great oatmeal stout full of rich flavors. Strong on the nose, but overall a solid beer. I am surprised this is ranked as #1 as far as oatmeal stouts are concerned, but still a great beer!Mar 22, 2021\\', \\'5Pours dark and opaque, with a dark tan head with moderate retention and nice lacing. Aroma is heavy with roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Taste follows, with coffee being the dominant flavor, with just a hint of cocoa. A strong body from the oats and roasted malt make for a delightful experience, with just a hint of alcohol warmth rounding out the silky smooth mouthfeel.Mar 21, 2021\\', \\'5This is hands down one of my favorite stouts. This and Old Rasputin would have to duke it out for top honors. There are few high production stouts that are this good, sorry Guinness.Mar 19, 2021\\', \"4.75Ah yes, breakfast with the baby....this is the first stout I really appreciated. Once I started letting it warm a bit from fridge temp it really blossomed. It\\'s also a best buy at $9.99 a 4-pack.Mar 19, 2021\", \"5This stout blew my mind at my first sip sometime ago. For whatever reason I am preferring stouts, porters, red ales and bocks over IPAs which were my preferred brew for a long time.\\\\nThe flavors of Breakfast Stout rolled over the palate with many delicious surprises. It was (a while ago) my first experience with a coffee stout. Lots of body too. I wrote to Founder\\'s claiming and surprisingly they answered me! \\\\nTop shelf.Mar 18, 2021\", \\'4.5Black in color with a head that lingers with light brown.\\\\nSpicy aroma with a bit of malt and coffee as it warms.\\\\nThis brew is full-bodied and creamy. A wonderful stout!Mar 05, 2021\\', \\'4.75Classic Oatmeal Stout, the appearance is ideal, lacing is prominent and lasting, aroma is ideal for the genre and the flavor, so full of coffee and oatmeal and malts and cocoa- just really tasty.\\\\nThe feel is near perfect for an oatmeal stout and as far as over all, this is one that will definitely always be in my cellar.Feb 18, 2021\\', \\'5L- A rich midnight black color with a hazelnut head\\\\nS- Strong notes of barley and oatmeal, hints of coffee make this part of a complete breakfast. Reminds me of a diner\\\\nT- Many layers. A sweet black coffee taste in the beginning with a strong oatmeal and chocolate taste as the drink continues\\\\nM- Not as thick as one would think but average for a thiccer stout\\\\nO- Founders never ceases to impress, incredible in every way. What started by love of dark beer.Feb 17, 2021\\', \"4.75What can I say for a beer I\\'ve been a fan of for ages. I can buy a four of FBS for less than 9 bucks. I used to seek out this beer when it was hard to find and paid $15 a 4 pack back then. If you\\'re a fan you know what the beer taste like. Say no more. This beer speaks for itself in its own category. It\\'s always delicious.Feb 12, 2021\", \\'4.5Definitely coffee up front, dark chocolate malt, dark fruit, medium mouthfeel, a light lingering bitterness. A wonderful stout that sets the standard.Feb 10, 2021\\', \"4.5I have wanted to one of these for the longest time. Knew there was a winter storm coming and picked up a six. Just spent 3 hours shoveling 18 inches of snow. Deep coffee brown on the pour with a beige head and thick lace. Aroma is heavenly -- rich coffee, roasted oats, malts and chocolate. Taste follows the aroma and each sip presents sweet and malty bitter notes. Feel is creamy and full-bodied. ABV is 8.3% but doesn\\'t come on strong. This is one is \\'world-class\\' and more than lives up to its reputation.Feb 01, 2021\"]'"
