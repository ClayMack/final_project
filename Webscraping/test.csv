<br/>
edit: the more i drink this the more i appreciate the complexity, all the oatmeal in the mash really frothing this up, and the overall quality. this might have been a little more original back in the day, now there are hundreds of poser beers trying to be this one, and the original still stands up as one of the best. its famous for good reason. tons and tons of coffee!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=StonedTrippin#review"">Aug 27, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/metter98.95017/"">metter98</a></b> from New York</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.45</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>A: The beer is jet black in color.

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toasted oats, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee/chocolate, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toasted oats, dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Good amount of roasted coffee and herbal hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toasted oats, dark bread, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee/chocolate, and earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible imperial coffee stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, coffee/chocolate, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. An insanely enjoyable and delicious offering as usual.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=superspak#review"">Jul 18, 2015</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/zeff80.63854/"">zeff80</a></b> from Missouri</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.45</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>A - Poured out an opaque, thick, jet black color with a small, very foamy, brown head.

Brewed with impecable balance and elegant strength, Founders Breakfast Stout is an ale for the ages!<br/>
<br/>
The beer's appearance of motor oil carries a creamy visual weight, complete opaqueness, and a lush volumptuous quality. A delicate creme of foam muddles about in a thin sheet that skirts the glass and shows more legging than lace which further reinforce the viscous overall demeanor<br/>
<br/>
Espresso, heavy cream, cocoa, heavy toast and roast all help to define the nose. Background notes of scorched molasses, walnuts, and charred woods all play into the roasty aromas.<br/>
<br/>
Espresso also dominated the flavor. Stout characteristics of deep caramel, toffee, vanilla, and rudementary malt all play on the mouth with a succulent and savory taste that doesn't introduce endless complexity, but rather puts the coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and cream flavors in bold display.<br/>
<br/>
Viscous, nearly chewy textures have a mouth-coating, creamy, thick mouthfeel that proved unwaivering until very late in finish. Bitterness from hops, roasted grains, and coffee give a strong rebuttal from the malts and accompany a moderate astringent seemingly of spent coffee grounds.<br/>
<br/>
Any fan of strong brewed coffees are sure to fall head over heels in love with this beer.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=BEERchitect#review"">Feb 07, 2006</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/uclabrewn84.439438/"">UCLABrewN84</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.45</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Thanks to SamuelJackson45 for sending me a few bottles of this one!<br/>

Pours a pitch black with a 1 inch dark beige head that fades to a nice small cap. Thick rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of robust coffee, dark chocolate, and some roasted oats. Taste starts with rich coffee followed by cocoa powder and the oats. Slight cocoa nib bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer is on the thicker side with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel even with a low level of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good stout and another winner from Founders.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=UCLABrewN84#review"">May 12, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/biboergosum.168458/"">biboergosum</a></b> from Canada (AB)</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.15</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-8.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>A 16oz, Yankee 'pint', on-tap at the splendiferous Oak Cafe in Wyandotte, Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
This beer appears a solid black abyss, with no edges, and one flabby finger of puffy, finely foamy, and somewhat creamy brown head, which leaves a nice array of layered hanging frilly lace around the glass in its rather lazy wake. <br/>
<br/>
It smells of roasted, gritty and grainy caramel malt, bittersweet cocoa powder, day-old exotic coffee grounds, a hint of black licorice spice, and some mild earthy, musty, and floral green hops. The taste is medium dark chocolate wafers, grainy and crackery cereal malt, fairly acrid cuppa Joe, ethereal sour cream, smoked chicory, and some tame leafy, earthy, and herbal hoppiness.<br/>
<br/>
The carbonation is average in its palate-satisfying frothiness, the body a stoic medium weight, and actually quite smooth, with a hint of creaminess evolving as things quickly warm up around here. It finishes off-dry, just, with a neat Coffee Crisp note, and tinted by some lurking and edgy hop character.<br/>
<br/>
Overall - a lovely coffee-forward eye-opener of a big-boy stout, this practically begs for another. Wait, 9% ABV - really? Good god! There will be enough drinking with the extended family later in the day, so perhaps I will reluctantly stop at the one. Sigh.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=biboergosum#review"">Sep 22, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jlindros.163147/"">jlindros</a></b> from Massachusetts</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.45</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Now THIS is a beer, a man's beer. It's what you grab in the morning that will get you through the day. It's the Wheaties for beer drinkers, already mixed with your coffee. That aside, is it just me, or does the weird lookin kid on the label give anyone else the creeps? He looks like a 45 year old baby spooning crack into his mouth... anyways, here's my review, hope you enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
Note, just popping the cap unlocked this huge aroma of coffee and chocolate making me salivate like one of Pavlov's dogs.<br/>
<br/>
A: Pours with a luscious rich chocolate covered head that fades pretty quickly. Its super dark colored that barely lets any light through, and the few photons making it through have been so distorted they're forever stained with darkness and probably traveled through time somehow. It doesn't pour super thick, but is much thicker than most beers.<br/>
<br/>
N: OOooohhh yeahhhh!!! It's like super coffee espresso mating with chocolate and popping out babies of light alcohol. The roasted malt on the nose is so rich I can feel it charring my nasal cavity. A huge dark chalky chocolate aroma dances as it mingles with the roasted malts and coffee. A light alcohol finds its way through the crazy malts, coffee, and chocolate, to tingle your nose a bit. I think I detect a slight oat as well, feeding back into that breakfast theme. If only I could pour buttloads of chocolate, coffee, alcohol, and essence of pour roastedness into my oatmeal in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
T: A heavy stouty flavors starts the taste, but it quickly changes to roasted malts. Those things dominate the taste big time. Some bitter dark chocolate and earthy charred taste start to come through as well followed by some alcohol. Then some more oats, yes it is for breakfast. A slight sweet chocolate milk runs down the back of your mouth and is mostly masked by the crazy strong flavors up front. I get some coffee on the taste, but nothing like what I expected from the plethora that poured out on the nose. <br/>
<br/>
M: Pretty thick, but still slightly watery, enough so that you can actually drink it instead of having to chew it. The alcohol tingles the mouth all over. Pretty light on the carbonation.<br/>
<br/>
F: Finishes semi dry surprisingly, but still has some sweet undertones. The earthy charred roasted chocolate stout bitterness flavor &amp;lt;taking a breath&amp;gt; really stick around for a bit as the liquid coats the mouth. I can almost taste the black flavor and darkness that come from it. It's like the flavor of ""black"". I also get a slight oat taste long after its over. <br/>
<br/>
Final thoughts: A very big heavy stout. Pretty thick on taste and mouth, but not so much you can't drink it. It has a nice alcohol taste, but not overbearing. Toooons of roasted malts, chocolate malts, dark roasted tasty goodness, oats, hay... wait not that, and the essence of pure darkness. A great drinking beer, and it gets much better with age as I have experienced before. I'll probably save most of the case I got, but drink one from time to time to help me through the cold winter coming.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=jlindros#review"">Oct 19, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/sammy.3853/"">Sammy</a></b> from Canada (ON)</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.27</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-6.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Masterful combination of coffee and chocolate in this stout, with the oatmeal making its appearance at well.

Beautiful label art. And.... enjoyed for breakfast!<br/>
<br/>
The Breakfast Stout pours an opaque black body beneath a creamy tan of brownish-tan foam that holds exceptionally well and leaves beautiful walls of thin lace throughout most of the glass.<br/>
<br/>
The nose is bright and exciting with notes of coffee/espresso, nuts, roasted barley, dark chocolate, and (amazingly) oatmeal. It's enough to make me want a cup of mocha java!<br/>
<br/>
In the mouth, it's full bodied and superbly creamy with just a delicate tingle upfront due to its moderate carbonation.<br/>
<br/>
The flavor is even richer and fuller than the nose leads you to believe, with mouthcoating flavors of delicate fruit (strawberries, maraschino cherry); sweetened mocha java; darker-roasted espresso; dark chocolate; fudge brownies; cereal notes (from the oatmeal?); and some grassy and leafy hops - all backed by a solid, underlying bitterness that ushers in its long-lingering, roasty and bitter finish (that's not too unlike a cup of dark black coffee!).<br/>
<br/>
Its complexity lies within its richness, meaning that what you percieve changes from sip to sip as opposed to a beer that presents its characteristics in some kind of order repeatedly throughout the glass.<br/>
<br/>
The alcohol is never noticeable; and it's hard to restrain the acidity in a beer that offers this much dark and roasty malt, but it's perfectly balanced and quite drinkable!<br/>
<br/>
Not unlike the World Wide Stout from Dogfish Head, this pushes the envelope and deserves credit just for that... but it also delivers as well!!!

Superb example of Imperial Coffee stout. Excellent balance of tastes with clear presence of coffee, malt and hops, and with both sweet and bitter components. Highly complex and dynamic flavors. Subtle chocolate flavor. Exceptionally smooth both while drinking and in finish. <br/>

How did I allow it to pass me by for so long? I sought this one out even though it only comes in a Bottle while I am trying to eradicate my backlog. That is indicative of how important it is to me to get this one in. <br/>
<br/>
From the Bottle: ""Double Chocolate Coffee Oatmeal Stout""; ""60 IBUs""; ""The coffee lover's consummate beer. Brewed with an abundance of flaked oats, bitter and imported chocolates, and two types of coffee, this Stout has an intense fresh-roasted java nose topped with a frothy, cinnamon-colored head that goes forever.""<br/>
<br/>
I began by Pop!ping the cap &amp; knowing that it was a very fresh bottle, I proceeded with a C-Line pour. Man, it came up quickly with a pseudo-cascade that formed two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with excellent retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled like my morning coffee - a mélange of deeply roasted beans from different locales that I blend together each day &amp; fill the basket to the point that the water has to be coaxed through the filter. Rich, strong coffee with hints of chocolate &amp; smoke. Mmm. Mouthfeel was thick, full, rich &amp; creamy, like a dollop of coffee-chocolate ice cream had been scooped onto my tongue. Mmm. The taste was at once chocolaty and coffee-like with a hint of smoke. Mmm. I have had this many times over, but always out in town, where I rarely do field reviews any more. It is always a treat, just like it was tonight. Loads of lacing formed as I drank through the beer, savoring every sip. I guess that I have taken it for granted in the past since my time with it for this review makes me feel like a born-again virgin. It was like I had never experienced it before, while I know that such was not the case. Finish was more chocolaty than coffee, so I am going to say that it was semi-sweet, but if you want to go with semi-dry, I am not going to put up much of a fight. This was a truly enjoyable experience.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=woodychandler#review"">Oct 09, 2018</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/greesyfizeek.721957/"">GreesyFizeek</a></b> from New York</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.78</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+5.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Poured on tap at The Village Tavern in Geneseo, NY.<br/>

Tastes incredible. Strong, bitter, slightly astringent coffee, sweet chocolate (cocoa powder and brownie batter are what I get), and oats.

The mouthfeel perfectly matches the flavor, thick, creamy, and almost a roasted character.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=REVZEB#review"">May 06, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/mactrail.311921/"">mactrail</a></b> from Washington</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.88</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-14.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Dry, powerful black ale.<br/>

Nice dark pour in the glass with a sepia head. Lacing lasts well, decent carbonation in the mouth. Less sweet than other Imperial Stouts. Lots of dry roasted malt flavors. Cocoa seems to be the aroma. Tastes of coffee grounds and burnt sugar. Hops do not seem to be a powerful as the 60 IBU claimed on the label. Surprisingly, the aftertaste is not all that bitter.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed several bottles of these in Chattanooga. A good dark, rich drink when you don't want overkill on either the sugar or the hops.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=mactrail#review"">Apr 24, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/woodbrew.549902/"">WoodBrew</a></b> from Ohio</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.4</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-3.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>In J'Town, PA and had a couple of night caps at the Boulevard.

I had never seen this in the LA area until recently. 8.3% confirmed. Expectations are through the roof; I had Kentucky Breakfast Stout and loved it. I'm hoping this lives up to the hype. Cost was $6.99 (people on the East Cost are probably cringing). <br/>
<br/>
Served straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm considerably over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. <br/>
<br/>
As I poured, no head was forming so I upped the vigor considerably. <br/>
<br/>
A: Pours a beautiful rich dark tan colour head half a finger thick with excellent cream. Retention is abysmal (maybe 20 seconds). Colour is a solid nontransparent jet black. It looks as it should for the style, but I would like to see better retention. It's a minor gripe. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Appears undercarbonated. <br/>
<br/>
Sm: Heavy rich coffee java notes. Heavy coffee bitterness. It really slaps you upside the head. I get minor chocolate, roast, and oatmeal notes - sure. But strong coffee is dominant. An aggressive strong aroma that goes for the jugular. Dark malts. It's very assertive and bold.<br/>
<br/>
No hops are detectable. No yeast or alcohol comes through.<br/>
<br/>
T: Heavy coffee, with some bitterness there at the finish. Chocolate malts and a bit of chocolate alongside dark malts comprises the foundation. I'm a bit surprised actually; it lacks a substantial body. Not a usual characteristic of beers in the style. Oats are there smoothening it through and through. No real cream. No yeast or alcohol comes through. The coffee notes are rich and biting. Hopping is minimal and floral but barely detectable (just as it should be). A light undertone of warm sherry throughout. I imagine this will improve as it warms. Some raisin, even some molasses sure. I don't get any herbal notes as some have reported. A touch viney. No real caramel. No nuts here. It isn't ""that kind"" of imperial stout. Very delicately balanced and built. They knew what they were doing when they put this treat together. As it warms, I get more true milk chocolate notes (not merely chocolate malt). <br/>
<br/>
Mf: I'm a bit taken aback at the blatant undercarbonation. It's naturally smooth from the oats, nicely wet, and quite chewy. Suits the flavours quite well, and it really evokes a clean breakfast beer - because who really wants carbonation in the morning. I understand the intentionality behind the choice, but that said I still think I'd prefer it creamier, thicker, and even a bit coarser and dryer. I like it as is, though; I'm just identifying personal preference. <br/>
<br/>
Dr: I can definitely see myself having this for breakfast. Boy that'd be good. Very drinkable; I imagine the caffeine zing from the coffee could keep you steadily drinking it for some time. It's not at all in the creamy heavy thick arena of imperial stouts. It's more a sharp coffee imperial stout, and in that it's quite a success. I'm not disappointed with it, but I will say that I remember enjoying KBS far more than this offering. Still, Founders seems to always deliver - at least based on the few beers I've had from them. At $6.99, I wouldn't get this again, but would at $3.99 or better. A must-try for fans of the style; great for the style. It doesn't quite join the ranks of something like Brunch Weasel or Speedway stout in terms of coffee-centric imperial stouts, but it flirts with that level; pretty impressive at this price point. Hides its ABV delightfully well. I'll definitely be having this again, ideally aged or on draught. An understated, elegant beer. Bravo, Founders. <br/>
<br/>
I initially gave it a B+, but changed it up to an A- because as it warmed, it got noticeably better. Give her some time once you pull her out of the fridge. It's worth it.<br/>

Bottle from Duff27. Adding some brief notes; served into stemware.<br/>
<br/>
A: Retention is better than the first review - a good 4 minutes. I think the glassware makes a big difference; I poured pretty lightly. Creamy, dark, appealing. <br/>
<br/>
Sm: Strong black coffee. Evident bitterness. Very assertive. Evocative oatmeal too; oats are usually undetectable and contribute mainly to mouthfeel but they're evident here. I like that.<br/>
<br/>
T: Heavy coffee with accompanying bitterness and roast. The coffee here is really genuine; it doesn't shy away from the raw coffee bean character. <br/>
<br/>
Mf: Creamy, chewy, coarse. Perfect dryness. <br/>
<br/>
Dr: A solid brew; lives up to its well earned reputation. Possibly the best value beer of its quality. <br/>

Pours a 1/2 finger thick/full mocha colored tan head. Doesn't last very long. Some very little lace manages to stick thinly to the glass. Color is a pure dark brown, basically black. <br/>
4-4.5<br/>
<br/>
Aroma: Coffee, cocoa, chocolate. A big malt taste. Some type of nuts. Main smell is the coffee. Slight booze. I am loving the smell.<br/>
<br/>
Taste: Coffee and coffee beans. Chocolate and cocoa. Some nuts. Taste is just like the smell. Big malt flavor, slight booze, earthy hops are a little present. A very great tasting beer. <br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy. Full bodied. Seems like a good amount of carbonation. Somewhat boozy. Leaves a a pretty dry, coffee taste of an aftertaste.<br/>

Dark chocolate and oatmeal are the predominant smells. This is not as harsh as some Stouts, there's seems to be less black patent malt. <br/>
<br/>
The flavor is something special: it is more ""dark"" than the smell would lead you to believe. Here, the black patent malt shows up in spades. The burnt flavors last throughout the taste long after the swallow. This is not a chewy beer; I'd describe it as rather thin for the style, but the carbonation is low, so it doesn't seem ""off"" to me. It's a dry stout with a lot of ground coffee and bitter chocolate flavor.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=smcolw#review"">Dec 25, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/alieniloquium.277522/"">Alieniloquium</a></b> from Florida</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.03</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-11.4%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>12 oz. bottle poured into a goblet.<br/>
<br/>
Appearance - Very dark body with an ample khaki head. A little light passes through the edges, so it's not as dark as the Imperial Stout. The head lasts forever; impressive for a stout.<br/>
<br/>
Smell - Coffee, but not intense coffee, which is nice. While the coffee is dominant, I get a nice chocolate aroma and a distinctly different roasted malt. I didn't give this beer enough credit the first time I had it.<br/>
<br/>
Taste - Coffee in the front, of course, followed by chocolate primarily. It has a strong coffee bitterness throughout, but finishes pretty clean.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel - Surprisingly light bodied for the ABV. 8.3% isn't that high, I suppose, but still it drinks nicely. High carbonation in this bottle. So high that it almost feels dry in the finish.<br/>
<br/>
Overall - I may not be the best judge of coffee stouts. I really like stout flavors to come through. This one does a better job that most coffee stouts, but still, I like the stout more than the coffee. Nonetheless, it's a beer I would never turn down.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=Alieniloquium#review"">Oct 06, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/sabtos.1081399/"">Sabtos</a></b> from Ohio</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.03</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-11.4%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Black with a thick, fluffy tan head.<br/>

Big coffee and chocolate aromas waft off this brew when fresh. Fresh is key, because the coffee dies off quickly with older bottles--I learned this the hard way: do not age this beer unless you want a sub-par, plain and bitter stout.<br/>
<br/>
Taste of coffee comes through powerfully, with some bitterness, but also a smooth texture with a rounding sweet, dark chocolate element.<br/>
<br/>
FBS is nicely dry, with heavily roasted malt that gets more powerful as it warms, almost becoming smokey. With a fresh, perfect mix of chocolate, coffee and roastiness, and a round, soft tangy body, this is quite a tasty classic. I would drink this all the time if I didn't inundate myself with various other brews to kill off.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=Sabtos#review"">Dec 20, 2015</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/russpowell.19986/"">russpowell</a></b> from Arkansas</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.41</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-3.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Cheers to joe1510 for this one! <br/>

The flavor was a lively blend of the sweetness of the oatmeal to chocolate to coffee and subsequently lead into the aftertaste with a fine smooth roast. Hops seem to be extremely faint. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with some sessionable traits to it. Semi-dry finish with a good carbonation about it. ABV felt as projected.

Roasted coffee in the aroma, not huge, but certainly of high quality. <br/>
<br/>
Medium level acidity from the beans, some dark fruit like grape or plum in the initial aftertaste. Deeply roasted chocolate malt serves as the major component, with an unparalleled smoothness from the oats. More drinkable than most beer, and most coffee. This seems slightly more enjoyable on tap, but the novelty may be playing into that for me. <br/>

If I actually drank beer for breakfast, this would be one I would want quite often.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=LiquidAmber#review"">Jan 21, 2017</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/themaniacalone.37950/"">TheManiacalOne</a></b> from Rhode Island</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.25</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-6.6%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Acquired via trade from jpm30, so a big Thank You goes out to him.

<br/>
A: The beer is a deep black color, with a short brown head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.<br/>
<br/>
S: The aroma is of roasted coffee, creamy chocolate, oats and dark malts.<br/>
<br/>
T: The taste is exactly what you would expect, creamy, malty and full of flavors of black coffee, dark chocolate and toasted oats. There's a mild but complimentary hops presence that provides a nice balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet with a touch of coffee &amp; chocolate bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.<br/>
<br/>
D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice stout to relax with and drink a few.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=TheManiacalOne#review"">Feb 20, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/tone77.332060/"">tone77</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.55</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-22%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5</span><br/><br/>Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle.

<br/>
A: Pours jet black with a thing light tan head. The head reduces quickly to a thin layer of bubbles at the edges of the glass. Moderate lacing is observed.<br/>
<br/>
S: Smells of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. There is some bitterness in the aroma and a decent amount of complexity.<br/>
<br/>
T: Roasted malts up front with slight amounts of sweetness, followed by hints of chocolate and coffee, and finishes with a coffee bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
M: Medium to full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly creamy.<br/>
<br/>
O: Quite easy to drink and hides the presence of the alcohol. Good complexity but pales in comparison after just having KBS - and seems slightly out of balance with the sweet and bitter.

Listed as brewed with Chocolate, Sumatra and Kona coffee (Aug 2011).<br/>
<br/>
A foamy dark brown dark chocolate big head is produced that sits on a jet black body. It sits... and sits.. and sits. There it is with big retention and aggressiveness in all it's creamy glory. While drinking giant circular sticky rings of lace just coat the glass, leaving a few chocolate looking marshmallow caps in the middle. Just a fantastic looking beer.<br/>
<br/>
Nose just gives the goods. Giant fresh ground ripped coffee beans with dark chocolate notes. Intensely coffee forward, cream, and other glory. Blurs the line for beer, just a mix of impressive creation and hint of greatness to come.<br/>
<br/>
Taste is all that and still a bag of chips. Morning ritual espresso with typical silky texture and creaminess. Chocolate maintains some dark bitter hints that flow without the beers malt, but gets whipped up, almost frothy. Malt backbone almost completely masked in a frenzy of milky thick coffee and chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
I just love this beer to death, and it is more coffee dominant on tap it seems than its bottled brother. If I could borrow a cheesy line, it goes ""it doesn't get any better than this."" (or does it?). Cheers to Founders!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=Smakawhat#review"">Sep 17, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/buckeyenation.3819/"">BuckeyeNation</a></b> from Iowa</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.63</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+1.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Liquid devil's food cake. This may be the first beer I've ever seen that has no highlights. The liquid crowds the edges of the glass so snugly, and with such menace, that light dare not attempt to get a foothold. Most impressive. The dark golden, milk chocolate crown is a beast. It squats with an equally forbidding countenance in the top quarter of the glass, daring any lovers of fizzy yellow beer to approach, much less take a sip.<br/>
<br/>
The nose is huge and is redolent of crushed coffee beans and melted dark chocolate. And then some more coffee beans. And then some more. This has to be the most coffee-dominant nose in the known universe. At least in my known universe. I am not a coffee aficionado by any means, but I have to give the aroma the respect it deserves. If I loved coffee, this might be my Holy Grail of beer noses.<br/>
<br/>
Incredible palate-busting flavor. Thankfully, bittersweet chocolate is equally as prominent as espresso. So much so that the beer tastes like dark chocolate fudge made with black coffee as the liquid ingredient. I knew that Founders wouldn't disappoint in the hop department. The citric hops play an integral role in turning Breakfast Stout from what could have been an (admittedly incredible) two-trick pony into a three-trick thoroughbred. They deepen the flavor profile even further and firmly place this beer into the pantheon of Great Beer.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet and bitter vie for supremacy, with bitter winning in the end. The finish is more than long, it's downright obstinate. Seemingly interminable echoes of chocolate-coffee/coffee-chocolate reverberate long after the beer has met its glorious fate in my warming belly. The body/mouthfeel is big, yet doesn't make it all the way to viscous or chewy. Still though, it's incredibly smooth and creamy and is sheer joy in the mouth. 8.3% ABV? Surely they jest. There is no hint of ethanol to be had.<br/>
<br/>
FBS deserves its reputation and then some. My preferences run to the less java-intensive, but then it wouldn't be a breakfast stout, would it? This brewery continues to delight and amaze with quality beer after quality beer. Breakfast Stout is an outstanding achievement by any measure.

Got a tip from a friend this was on-tap nearby. Yay. It pours a solid black topped by a finger of nice tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate (both dark and milk), coffee, roasted malts, and molasses. The taste follows this pre-beaten path, though the molasses is diminished, the chocolate seems entirely dark, and the coffee lends a nice bit o' bitterness with its roastedness. The body is a rather hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, a very tasty brew; not necessarily as awesome as the barrel-aged varieties, but more than strong enough as it is.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=TMoney2591#review"">Oct 22, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/clayrock81.170415/"">clayrock81</a></b> from Florida</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.25</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-6.6%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Pours a stiff one-finger tan head of a viscous black body - it even pours slow like a thick, viscous fluid. A trong malty aroma of roasted, bitter and dark chocolate, coffee and possibly some oak malts. Thsi beer is everything a double stout should be: medium-to-full bodied, smooth and creamy like butter, sweet with chocolate notes and yet has a dry backbite thanks to the roasted and coffee notes. Mixed well and also has some chewiness to it from some bread malt. Even has some minor molasses and/or maple syrup notes as it can get sticky at times. Great finish with a hint of fruity hop bitterness. ABV hidden well and slightly pricks the tongue - beer gets smoother the longer you drink.

Poured a thick dark black, pretty much opague oil looking liquid with a small tan colored head on the top. Copious side lace was present. The aroma was thick, fll of coffee, rich dark coffee and a good amount of sugar. Nice back of some lighter hoppiness maybe and a touch of brandy like alcohol. Very robust smell. The taste was awesome, simply awesome. A super smooth blend of rich coffee and chocolate, mixed in with just enough hoppiness to get you to notice. This was defintly top notch. I really loved the way it was all blended together. Nothing really overpowering, but the whole mix was just soo smooth. Rich creamy full bodied feel, very thick. I could easily have one on any cold night, this was just a super nightcap. Defintly lived up to its hype, one of the best coffee stouts I have ever tasted and I would love to have it again. If you get a chance, I would seek this one out, this was outstanding.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=mikesgroove#review"">Oct 28, 2007</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/wasatch.23172/"">Wasatch</a></b> from Colorado</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.67</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+2.6%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75</span><br/><br/>Revisit: 17 Nov 18<br/>

Poured into a Tree House glass a pretty nice dark brown color, with some pretty nice carbonation, which also leaves a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger tan head, which also leaves a pretty nice thick/creamy medium size island, and some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some nice chocolate/toffee, roasty coffee, with some vanilla. The taste is pretty nice, malty, with a really nice touch of chocolate/toffee, really nice roast coffee, with some vanilla. Medium body, ABV is hidden pretty nicely, a pretty nice complex brew.

<br/>
A: I poured this into my Arrogant Bastard pint glass and was struck by the absolute black, viscous nature of this beer. It has a thin layer of mocha foam on top.<br/>
<br/>
S: A huge wave of coffee aroma hit me right in the face, followed by bitter chocolate. A lot of roasted malt character comes through on subsequent sniffs, but I do not get much, if any oat.<br/>
<br/>
T: Just like the aroma, the taste is absolutely full of coffee. The chocolate and roast malt come through in force in the middle of the palate, and then the coffee comes back and lingers on the finish. The finish, besides being full of coffee flavor, also gives an excellent bitterness, probably from the coffee and chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
M: As I said in the appearance portion, this beer is very viscous. Despite the thickness, it is very smooth and goes down quite easily. The carbonation is low, but that's to be expected.<br/>
<br/>
D: I was expecting this to be a really tough to take down.

It comes with a large 1.5cm mocha head that dissipates slowly over the course of a few minutes into a thick mocha collar. The lacing here has been sporadic, nothing too special. It's pretty much a typical big stout in appearance. [4.25]<br/>
<br/>
Smelling the nose throughout makes me smile. I still smell a lot of dark cold-pressed coffee aromas along with hints of chocolate, toffee and roast malts. It smells sweet yet bitter. It is a very powerful nose that yells out ""breakfast"". [4.25]<br/>
<br/>
The beer itself is delicious. So creamy, full-bodied, smooth and easy drinking to go along with a delicious flavour profile of black coffee bitterness, dark chocolate bitter sweetness, faint roasted marshmallows and nuts along with a slight mild smokiness that isn't too overwhelming. Its so incredibly easy to drink and the flavour profile is very pleasing and balanced with the bitterness and roasty sweetness. Goes down very well, no booziness at all. The aftertaste is a faint smoky coffee and chocolate combination. [4.5, 4.5]<br/>
<br/>
I'm so glad this is a shelf turd for at least 3-4 months of the year. It is incredibly delicious, smooth and goes down so well. This is one of the best imperial stouts out there, no question about it. Its too bad it doesn't come in six packs, but I'll take it in whatever form it comes in. Highly recommend to anyone who likes stouts.. and those who don't- this might just convert you. [4.5]<br/>

You should have it for breakfast!"" is now coming into it's own as an individual style.)<br/>
Enough with the whimsy, time for the beer! <br/>
<br/>
This one is just what I need now, as the sub-zero wind-chill and the weather in general puts that witches teat to shame, and summarily lays waste to the well-digger's bum. I need something warm, rich and fortifying...is this it?<br/>
<br/>
Pours out a thick, impenetrable blackness, solid ebon, with slight ruby highlights at the foot of the glass. Head is mighty, massive, twisting slowly down to a most 1/2 "",burnt-toast brown, like chocolate shavings mingled with coffee grounds.<br/>
<br/>
Aroma is right on for the style and then some! Espresso is featured first, then chocolate, roasty all the way, gritty and earthy, rich and thick...a coffee stout that nears an Imperial. Almost like what happened the last time I mixed Bell's Java Stout with Expedition ...almost.<br/>
<br/>
Velvety feel on the tongue, almost magical the way this warmed-up stout lightly lays over the senses, drifting it's wonder throughout the mouth. Hops up front, rich coffee texture, tangible in the mouthfeel, a little hot and spicy, backed up by prodigious malt. Full-bodied, with a long, cocoa-coffee finish, plays delicately on the tongue, but lingers long. <br/>
<br/>
This is a very satisfying stout, one that meets almost all of my expectations. I have had coffee stouts with bigger coffee flavor, though, and oatmeals that are smoother and more richly rewarding, as well as chocolate stouts that bring that flavor in full force...this is a very accomplished blend of the three sub-styles of stout, it succeeded in it's mission quite well, which is to make me consider having this in my coffee cup every morning, inside of the usual dark roast Columbian!<br/>
<br/>
Damned good!<br/>

It pours dark brown to about black with a modest tan head.<br/>
<br/>
Wicked coffee aroma on the nose. Kind of a burnt malt character too and a moderate orange zing..<br/>
<br/>
Medium to better than medium body.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. This one cleanses the senses with its coffee or more specifically Espresso explosion. Moderate bitterness to finish.

<br/>
The smell is of chocolate and coffee - great selections of each - with some mollasses. There's an underlying earthiness and vague fruitiness.<br/>
<br/>
The taste is of rich, roasted coffee, rich chocolate - bittersweet. Light roast and bitterness balance sweetness. A touch of milk seems to come through as it progresses. Rich and complex with a slight acidic touch.<br/>
<br/>
It has a rich, creamy full-body that is silky smooth.<br/>
<br/>
Rich and complex, yet so drinkable - dangerously so - esp. for abv. Nice way to start or end the day (or both!)

<br/>
A - Midnight black pour with a nice healthy chocolate head that fades into a thick lacing. Everything a stout should look like.<br/>
<br/>
S - As soon as I began the pour I was overwhelmed by the amount of chocolate I could pick up. The mocha smell, combined with deep coffee and carmel sweetness.<br/>
<br/>
T - Really, really picking up on the chocolate and coffee. The balance between bitter and sweet is great. I personally would like a little less bitter and little more sweet chocolate though.<br/>
<br/>
M - Coats the mouth with a silky feeling that only a stout can do. Just superb.<br/>
<br/>
D - So, so good. The aromas, the mouthfeel, and the taste all work together on this. Cant stop drinking this.

Coffee was certainly the dominant scent, it took lots of sniffing to find any underlying malt or grain. I didn't pick up any chocolate in the nose either. On the tongue, coffee was still the major force of this beer. The chocolate did show up, put it wasn't enough to balance out the roast, almost burnt, taste of the coffee. The malt and grains played a cameo role in this act.<br/>
<br/>
The body was far too thin for a big stout, it washed over the palate too quickly, leaving just an increasingly burnt taste at the back. Drinkability was OK, which is saying something as I am a confirmed coffee hater. Overall, a pretty good beer, certainly worth trying, and the more you like coffee, the more you'll like this.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=BBThunderbolt#review"">Nov 11, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/bitterbill.708/"">Bitterbill</a></b> from Wyoming</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.82</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+5.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>This one was aquired in a trade with Wasatch.

<br/>
This pours from 12oz bottle a near pitch black with a very small tannish head of foam that dissipated quickly. I took the bottle straight out of the fridge so I'm going to take my time in enjoying this brew.<br/>
<br/>
The smell has some nice roasted malt and I'm also gettting some dark fruit and toffee.<br/>
<br/>
The taste, wow, to start off with, this is a very thick and chewy stout translating to a very nice mouthfeel. <br/>
I'm getting lots roasted malt and sweet malt goodness that is followed up by notes of coffee and coffee bitterness but the thing is, although it's so darned loaded with flavours..oh, there's the toffee I noted in the nose and there's some good chocolate *and* hot cocoa presence as well...anyway, I'm equally impressed with how smooth it is to drink and how well the alcohol is hidden. This one has drinkabilty written all over it.<br/>
<br/>
A few more sips in and the flavours haven't diminished one iota but sadly, the amount of liquid in my glass *has* and that makes me sad. This is terrific stuff! And...I'm having it for breakfast; how apropos. The finish for me is both bitter and sweetish and the aftertaste lingers on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: I finally got the chance to try this highly touted Double Stout and it did not fail to impress. It's a MUST try for those who don't find it in their local market.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=Bitterbill#review"">Jul 08, 2007</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/knapp85.408506/"">Knapp85</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-1.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Had this beer a while ago and now I'm revisiting it.

The coffee kind of blends in with the malts and chocolate. The taste is so nice, the flavors are just balanced so well. Chocolate, coffee, sweet dark roasted malts and oats.

This is one heck of a tasty stout. The brewers apparently loaded this one up with a couple of different coffee beans and a variety of chocolates, and, to me, they seem to have hit the mark in bringing these ingredients together in a very appealing way. Depth and complexity galore and nicely balanced to boot. I just wish this was readily available in Colorado...<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=beergoot#review"">Jan 20, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/mdfb79.414386/"">mdfb79</a></b> from New York</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-1.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Had a bottle last night.

<br/>
a - Pours a dark black color with one and a half fingers of tan head and light carbonation evident. Looks amazing.<br/>
<br/>
s - Smells of coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, vanilla, and chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
t - Tastes of coffee, roasted malts, both bitter and sweet chocolate, and vanilla.<br/>
<br/>
m - Medium body and low carbonation. Rich and very smooth; very easy to drink considering it's over 8% ABV.<br/>
<br/>
d - I think this may be my favorite stout that is widely available and I'm able to buy straight off the shelf. Coffee is the front runner in the smell and taste, but it is very well balanced in both. I enjoy how the taste has both sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate/coffee balanced very well.

<br/>
Smell: rich, smooth coffee right at first, segueing into a sweeter, chocolatier, maltier character. Very nice indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Taste: tons of coffee at first, transitioning into a more chocolate-based flavor at the end; it's got the same dynamics as the aroma. Finish is deep and bitter, very much like a dark chocolate. Nicely complex and very tasty indeed.<br/>

As with all incarnations of the Breakfast Stout, this one's a stunner. Jet black, large creamy head that lasts for what seems to be an eternity, leaving tons of lace. On the nose, it's gorgeous, with a ton of chocolate and coffee. Not too sweet, and the coffee character is fantastic. On the palate, it opens up with a ton of chocolate and coffee, with the chocolate being more prominent than out of the bottle. The combination is just delectable. Some oatmeal flavor is present, adding to the wholesomeness of this beer. Medium bodied with an excellent finish with espresso and dark chocolate characteristics, it's awesome. The nitro-pour is a little disappointing, though - the first few sips are incredibly creamy, but as I wait for the beer to warm up, it turns to being a little flat and just a little watery. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed my glass, and I wasn't leaving immediately, I'd have had another.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=DefenCorps#review"">Sep 18, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/huhzubendah.168653/"">Huhzubendah</a></b> from District of Columbia</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-1.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>A: Opaque black, the void.

My general opinion is this : If you are a coffee lover, drink it fresh. <br/>
<br/>
If you prefer the chocolate and oatmeal, age it AT LEAST 10 months, if not a year. Between 12-14 months is the PRIME, PRIME time to have this beer if that's what you're looking for. The following is after 12 months of careful aging in the dark, upright.<br/>
<br/>
Aromas of sweet milk chocolate, chocolate covered prunes, and cooked oatmeal. <br/>
<br/>
Flavors are of bitter and milk chocolates, lactose, and oats. <br/>
<br/>
Feel is syrupy and thick. <br/>
<br/>
Age it in the dark for best results. I have adjusted the scores to reflect aging it a year.<br/>

------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Oh my. A 100/100? Had to try this.<br/>
<br/>
It looks : used motor oil coming out of the sump, or crude oil even, just beautifully black and obsidian. The head is a measles 1 finger but has a nice almond color to it. The body is completely a black hole, no light escaping. <br/>
<br/>
It smells : Lots of coffee, some french silk pie, and cappuccino aromas. Lots of burnt malts as well. <br/>
<br/>
It tastes : tons of dark burnt coffee with a backbone of scorched chocolate. This is very heavy on coffee and burnt roast malts, much less exciting than last years batch which had more chocolate, cookie dough, and oatmeal. <br/>
<br/>
It feels : medium to heavy bodied but still easy to drink. The carbonation is buzzing and alive, but is still kept in check by the heavy roasted malt body which provides the creamy backbone. <br/>
<br/>
Overall : A worthwhile stout and if you haven't tried it, you owe it to yourself. It's a nice stout, although not really one of my absolute favorites. I recently scored some 4 packs for $6.99 so that was worth purchasing. To be honest I Wouldn't be purchasing this left and right at full price, but if I ran out, I'd probably keep four on hand.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=hoptheology#review"">Feb 22, 2015</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/gavage.1881/"">Gavage</a></b> from Nevada</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.43</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.6%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Appearance: pours a black color with a 1"" tan colored head.

<br/>
Smell: loads of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee are easy to detect. Some bitterness comes through too.<br/>

Taste: follows the nose as the roasted malt and chocolate malt base are big and meaty. Some soft burnt coffee tones, prunes, and a heart bitterness rounds it out. Alcohol is mildly noticeable.<br/>

Drinkability: one of the tastier beers in the style made today.

Head retention and lacing are both very good. It smells like roasted coffee, bittersweet/dark chocolate, roasted malt and a little bit of dark fruit. The aroma is excellent. Taste is impressive, with coffee, dark chocolate, charred/burnt wood, molasses and some bitter hoppiness in the finish rounding out the flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, with the beer being smooth, slick and silky. Alcohol isn't very noticable at all. Drinkability is pretty good too! Overall I think this is a very, very good brew.

<br/>
The color is black, it is opaque with thin tan cap w/ tiny beads. The lace clings in a spotty fashion. The aroma is full of coffee, very mild caramel with slight cocoa accents and a roasty overall nose. The feel is dry and roasty, but has a mild bitterness with slight fruitiness and silky feel that the oats give with medium body and gentle acidity. <br/>
<br/>
The taste begins slightly nutty and sweet w/ mild caramel malt and launches into a roasty coffee flavor which is both earthy, spicy and slight bitter with mild burnt elements, but very mild char with the yeast giving an almost creamy and fruity tanginess which compliments the tannin from the dark grain well. The hop spice and roasted malt character is not too far to come off as harsh, just enough to let the beans contribute their delightful flavor with a very mild alcohol compliment in the semi-dry roasty finish. Overall a classic coffee stout, simple hones to goodness and you get the added benefit of a little cocoa for an all around mocha-like Imperial stout. I recommend this to anyone who likes stouts coffee or both!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=Slatetank#review"">Oct 25, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/pat61.545285/"">pat61</a></b> from Minnesota</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+9.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>A: Bright black with a thin filmn of a head that disappears to nothing. <br/>

Served in my trusty Surly pint glass.<br/>
<br/>
A - Three fingers of medium-dark mocha foam that dissipates very slowly and leaves some patchy lacing. Black body with the tiniest sliver of dark brown at the bottom of the glass.<br/>
<br/>
S - Dark roast coffee, baker's chocolate, roasted malts, light floral hoppiness, hint of tobacco and smoke, a little bit of dark fruits and vanilla. Pretty complex - it's what a coffee stout should taste like!<br/>
<br/>
T - The taste has some pretty intense coffee bitterness, with more of a dark chocolate vibe happening. It's nicely balanced by sweet dark malts, vanilla, and a hint of fruit. Not as complex as the amazing smell (the light tobacco/smoke element is gone).<br/>
<br/>
M - Low carbonation, super smooth and oatmealy, with a medium-thick body that's actually a little thinner than I remembered. It's like a slightly melted milkshake. Roasty and dry finish that I really like.<br/>
<br/>
D - Damn, I put down most of this one in record time. The intense roastiness and slight coffee acidity might prevent me from having more than a few bottles, but this is super drinkable stuff.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those beers that I totally take for granted.

black, with 1/4"" tan head of fine bubbles, but then fades away quickly. wow, the aroma is extremely strong roasted espresso. the label touts chocolate, coffee, and oatmeal but it's all coffee in the taste. good flavor, but it's one dimensional. medium body and carbonation. <br/>
<br/>
Going with any Founders beer you can't go wrong, but as stouts go, I'd still look for the regular Imperial Stout and KBS first.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=jmdrpi#review"">Nov 09, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/garthdanielson.522584/"">GarthDanielson</a></b> from Virginia</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.83</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+6.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Poured on-tap and served in a snifter, the beer is an extremely dark molasses coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy, tan colored head. Steady flow of carbonation throughout the body. Aromas of dark roasted coffee, extremely rich dark chocolate/cocoa nibs, and a touch of smoke. Flavors are rich and heavy coffee forward, with smokey and chocolatey undertones that smooth out the bitter characteristics. Extremely smooth and rich in mouth, with a roasted, bitter aftertaste.

<br/>
Appearance – Pours a deep-deep brown, if not black, color with little to no light seeping through the brew. There was a thin brown had that formed and lasted about 1 min before fading to give some nice lacing.<br/>
<br/>
Smell – Sweet chocolate is heavy in the nose. This mixes in with a bit of roasted coffee and an ever so slight bit of vanilla toward the middle of the taste. While the chocolate is there throughout, it changes it aroma ever so slightly as it mixed with other aromas. Initially in the nose it is of sweet chocolate, but toward the end it becomes more bitter cocoa with an ever so slight boozy finish. Very nice.<br/>
<br/>
Taste –At first a bit of roasted bitter coffee and dark chocolate are detected. A nice oatmeal backbone then starts to mix with a little bit of sweet vanilla. This seems to sweeten the dark chocolate/cocoa flavor bringing it more to the realm of a sweet chocolate flavor. The bitter is not lost, however, and at the end of the taste sweet and bitter chocolate seem to mingle with a light alcohol flavor.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel – If there is any disappointing point to this beer, it would be that the mouthfeel (which really isn’t disappointing) which doesn’t live up to the taste, aroma, or look. It’s creamy but could actually use an ever so slight boost in creaminess; a little more tongue clinging smooth. The carbonation seems an ever so bit too much also. It is a nice feel overall, but in comparison to its other attributes (taste, smell and look) it is a bit weak.<br/>
<br/>
Overall – This is a very nice beer to sit back with and sip. The complexity of aroma and flavor are truly astounding, both of which transition very nicely.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=Darkmagus82#review"">Feb 08, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/drdemento456.330550/"">DrDemento456</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.8</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+5.5%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>World class beer finally ticked! Found this at my local bottle shop for only 4.25 a serving. Buy a four pack for only 15 bucks. Not all all a bad price for perfection!<br/>
<br/>
A - Poured from the bottle into my goblet so I can get a good smell. Looks thick and viscous with no light escaping it looks like a nice blacked imperial stout but ow snap! It's a oatmeal stout! Curious I take a whiff.<br/>
<br/>
S - Well nothing off putting here. Smells of some great quality coffee. Mostly malty. Slight sweetness. Smell a bit nutty.<br/>
<br/>
T - Not as Wow as I expected it to be ""hype train?"" Anyway not negative in anyway. You get a solid stout consisting of strong roasted coffee that doesn't bring much bitterness but making it smooth and enjoyable and mild chocolate sort of cocoa like. Nothing more or less but lovely.<br/>
<br/>
M - Even though it 8 percent it is surprisingly drinkable. Yet a sipper you would enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
D - Yeah I will pick up another four pack. Founders has always been good to me and I appreciate the effort they put into beers and a nice price tag to boot makes this one beer thats a must for my fridge.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=DrDemento456#review"">Oct 04, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/snaotheus.255457/"">snaotheus</a></b> from Washington</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.74</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+4.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75</span><br/><br/>12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.

Pours opaque black with a small head. No visible carbonation. Smell is gorgeous chocolate and coffee. Seriously delicious smelling. Lots of coffee.<br/>

S-Deep dark chocolate combined with a rich smell of roasty coffee beans. A bit smokey with a hint of oatmeal as well. A perfectly slight aroma of alcohol wraps up this complex smell.<br/>
<br/>
T-Super delicious coffee and chocolate explodes onto the palate. The like someone dipped coffee beans in dark chocolate. Brown sugar and molasses hop aboard. A mild bitterness adds to the complexity.

Smells like a really good coffee place, big notes of coffee grounds, with hints of chocolate, licorice and fudge.<br/>

I heard a lot of good things about this beer, and have never seen, let alone tasted, a breakfast stout. After nearly downing most of my pint glass, I'm not sure if I'd have this for breakfast, but I'm sure that this is one of the most unique and delicious beers that I've had in quite some time! <br/>
<br/>
This had a dark pour but not as thick as a Russian Imperial Stout. There was a little bit of head and practically no lacing to go along with this. The smell was a wonderful blend of dark chocolate, toffee, and of course, oatmeal, with the mouthfeel combining all of those notes with the thickness of the oatmeal and the alcoholic taste of fermented chocolate. It's basically a cross between the old Troegs Oatmael Stout and the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Yes, the alcohol can be felt here, especially in the aftertaste. Nevertheless, it's not overpowering and the roasted, espresso-like consistancy that wonderfully holds everything together! <br/>
<br/>
This is a strong beer, but the alcohol is never overpowering. I don't think I'd specifically have this for breakfast, but there wouldn't be a time of day where I'd pass this up! This was well worth the wait and effort to find - Founders has carved a very unique niche with this beer.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=JerzDevl2000#review"">Nov 10, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/halcyondays.145116/"">Halcyondays</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.17</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-8.4%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>From a 12 oz. bottle, courtesy of gregoryG, <br/>

A: Pours black with a moderate tan head, nice retention.<br/>
<br/>
S: All coffee, good complexity, very fragrant.<br/>
<br/>
T: More of a heavy dark chocolate flavour on the tongue as compared to the nose. Minor coffee - it's chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. Secondary notes of anise and licorice. Very good flavour overall.<br/>

This is not as good as those 2, but this is quality stuff for sure, I'm glad I finally got to try this legendary brew.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=Halcyondays#review"">Apr 13, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/cjgiant.741623/"">cjgiant</a></b> from District of Columbia</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.42</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25</span><br/><br/>Pours black with thin edge head, no real lacing.<br/>
<br/>
Smell is complex, mocha coffee chocolate is most often noted, but on different sniffs I noted more coffee at times, more chocolate at times, and a smokey cigarette smell at others. When tasting, the nose is ever present, and that's when I notice the smokiness the most.<br/>
<br/>
The taste itself is not as impressive as the nose, in my opinion. Roasted malt reigns, mocha in nature at heart. The bitterness that is there is a coffee bitterness, and the mouthfeel is a coating of roasted coffee feel.<br/>
<br/>
The average rating gives away the quality of the beer. The taste for me wasn't overly special if detached from the smell, which is not something one should necessarily deconstruct, they say. The taste reminds me of an old-time coffee house, complete with a cigarette smoke background.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=cjgiant#review"">Dec 11, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/corby112.268461/"">corby112</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-1.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Pours a thick black color with foamy coffe -colored head.

Shared with Sam and Rich in Sydney.<br/>
<br/>
Pours a solid deep brown, with a slightly pocked head of beige across the top of the glass which settles into a firm ring. Lace only forms dots, and the beer itself is less full and heavy as it might have been. Looks good though.<br/>
<br/>
Smell is exceptional: big cocoa roasted characters, but hit with a huge, pleasant, boozy, slightly astringent and slightly spicy capsaicin character. Slight coffee notes, but not as much as they might have been. Instead, the raw cocoa bitterness comes through much more. It's surprisingly fresh: big and tasty.<br/>
<br/>
Taste is much more integrated, and extremely pleasant, although for some reason it feels less aggressive and intense. Instead, the coffee works its way in pleasantly with some of the roasty oatmeal characters providing a broad and supple conglomeration of flavours. Feel is smooth and fine, perhaps lacking a little richness, but providing a broad basis for the interplay of flavours.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, this is an extremely pleasant and well-integrated beer. It seems to have an almost fanatical following that I can't quite subscribe to, but it is indeed a lovely beer. I would certainly enjoy drinking it more often.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=lacqueredmouse#review"">Sep 21, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/thesixthring.252427/"">TheSixthRing</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.32</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-5.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Appearance - Pours jet black with a dark, ruby brown where light can penetrate. The head pours light brown with a reddish hue, one finger thick and with average retention. <br/>
<br/>
Smell - Aroma is of fresh coffee grounds, earthy and with hints of chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
Taste - Dominant coffee character from start to finish. Hits on subtle notes of sweet and bitter chocolate. Earthy. There's a trace element of leaf or mint freshness mid-taste. Finishes bittersweet with just a hint of heat.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, with fair carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking.<br/>
<br/>
Overall - One hell of a stout. Lacks ideal body, but it's far from a problem. Hops are scaled back, relying on strong roasted malt character. It works, and it works well.

A not quite black and you can see deep under the foam, I can see a few bubbles streaming up the side of the glass, two fingers of dark foam leaves a few partial rings of lace before it falls.<br/>
<br/>
S lots of milk chocolate and coffee with some sponge toffee, I like the coffee notes but its pretty straight forward but solid <br/>
<br/>
T chocolate's a little darker in the mouth and a little sweeter, coffees a little more noticeable and works well, a little hard toffee but mostly coffee and coco <br/>

M not as thick as I would guess from the color but that still leaves a fair amount of body, creamy from the bubbles, a little slick and a nice lingering coco coffee mix<br/>

A: Pours an opaque black color. A small tan head forms, and recedes to a rim. I did not expect much here. Though some great sticky, spiderweb lace is left behind.<br/>
S: Dark roasted malt with coffee, chocolate and some alcohol. A nice aroma, but standard stout and not as aromatic as I would like.<br/>
T: Lots of dark roasted malt again. Coffee and some dry chocolate flavors. A large oatmeal flavor that I love, and seemed to be absent in the nose. This wonderful taste lingers on forever, and no one flavor stands out and overpowers everything else. Simply amazing!<br/>
M/D: A full body. It is exceptionally creamy, rich, and smooth. All the flavors are so well balanced and complex, which IMO, makes this amazingly easy to drink. I wish this would never end.<br/>

<br/>
A-This beer pours an inky black opaque body with tiny bubbles clinging to the glass. The head is a thin creamy deep tan color. <br/>
<br/>
S- The aroma is cold coffee, molasses, and a slight sour hint. <br/>
<br/>
T- The taste has a big coffee flavor. It has the taste of coffee grounds and a slight creamy chocolate note. There is a nice hint of hop bitterness at the finish. <br/>
<br/>
M- This has a thick creamy mouthfeel with no alcohol warmth. <br/>
<br/>
D- This beer is a coffee monster. It has big coffee taste that taste a little like cold coffee or coffee grounds not so much like a cup of fresh brewed coffee. The chocolate notes are faint but nice. I would like to taste a bit more grain with this brew but very interesting indeed.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/1199/11757/?ba=rhoadsrage#review"">Jun 25, 2005</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/roguer.725518/"">Roguer</a></b> from Connecticut</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-1.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>A - Pours a thick, oily blackness, oozing from the bottle.

S - The smell is boozy from across the room. Up close, bitter dark chocolate hides a hint of coffee. Just a hint of overripe dark fruit. I'm a little intimidated.<br/>
<br/>
T - First, slight bitterness on the tongue (it is 60 IBUs). Then, extremely dark chocolate everywhere all at once. A little flat on the flavor past the chocolate, though; huge dose of coffee, as well. Classic roasted barley and oats are clearly 2nd fiddle.<br/>
<br/>
M - Oily and thick. Not thick enough to chew, but it really clings to your mouth.<br/>

<br/>
A: The stout is pitch black with a gorgeous off-white head. The head filled several fingers of the glass and retained a thick consistency throughout.<br/>
<br/>
S: The nose is coffee, thick and acrid with a sweet chocolate undertone.<br/>
<br/>
T: The nitro pour has added a distinct smoothness to the ale, softening the blow of the imperial stout. The result is chocolatey with an overroasted quality. The coffee, strong as it is, has also been toned down. The flavors are sharp, concentrated like a cup of Starbucks.<br/>
<br/>
M: The creamy foam takes a great deal of the edge off of the ale, making it much more enjoyable even if some of the dominant coffee flavors have subsided.<br/>

While not as strong as Worldwide Stout, this beer is still a great sipping beer. Both are probably the only stouts that I've had so far that deserve their ratings. <br/>

D: For the most part, the alcohol is well masked, which makes this beer not that difficult to drink.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=metter98#review"">Nov 24, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/superspak.456300/"">superspak</a></b> from North Carolina</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.2</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/25/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange rind, herbal, floral, pine, caramel, biscuit, mango, peach, toast, and earthiness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, pine, herbal, floral, caramel, toast, biscuit, peach, mango, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of smooth and spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, pine, peach, mango, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of pronounced caramel and toasty malt sweetness, with smoothly bitter hop flavors; very good flavor complexity and balance as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a pretty creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA. The English two row adds a nice unique dimension to the flavor profile; and it has a very smooth balance of hoppiness with the malt profile. Highly enjoyable, and I am glad I was able to get this really fresh for this re-review after not having had this one for a couple years.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=superspak#review"">Aug 09, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/zeff80.63854/"">zeff80</a></b> from Missouri</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.62</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+7.4%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>A - Poured out a clear, copper/amber color with a small, white head.

<br/>
Aroma: Fruits abound everywhere. Citrus fruits, dark fruits, spicy fruits. Definate bittering hops and added spices consequently. Mouth watering to tge smell. Mild tones of ethynol for a high alcoholic beer.<br/>
<br/>
Appearance: Deep coppers, oranges, rust, and browns. Just off from clear (always makes things interesting). Nice off white head rose to about and inch and remained. Medium dense head that laced well. Also a nice cling to the glass as I swirled it around.<br/>
<br/>
Taste: An aggressive blend of malts and hops. Very powering imediately. Malts pick up a lot of caramels, coconuts, other nuts, hints of brown sugar and deep fruits (figs?). Spiced up from multiple varieties of hops--fused well into the malts. Full and rich through the body, releasing multiple flavors as it crosses the palate. Picking up the bittering hops, spices, and citrus at it travels. Finishes full and moist. Most definately alcoholic. Polishes the palate very well.<br/>
<br/>
Aftertaste: delicate balance of lingering malts, hops, and spice. Also develops over the course of a few minutes. Not terribly dry for a 9%er.<br/>
<br/>
Impression: A well balanced, well aged IIPA. Very complex and satisfying. There is a flavor in there for all beer lovers. One worth stocking the frige with.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=BEERchitect#review"">Jun 11, 2005</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/uclabrewn84.439438/"">UCLABrewN84</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.03</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-29.5%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3</span><br/><br/>A - Pours a clear pale honey with a nice 2 inch white head that fades to an oily cap.

I've been saving it for some reason, mostly because all my beer-drinking attention of late has been directed at the wonderful local seasonals. Now that we've got a cool, rainy day, at the beginning of August no less, time to let this dog out...<br/>
<br/>
This beer pours a slightly hazy copper colour, with an inch of sticky, bubbly head, that takes a few minutes to disappear. Looks like a consummate IPA. The smell is very malty, with a background essence of citrus-aroma hops. A bit of heat in there too. The taste is very heavy on the sweet, molasses side, until the follow through on the finish, where the sides of my mouth perked up to the latent hop character in the balancing act that is this beer. I think the hops may have quieted down a fair bit in this bottle, which is over a year old, the majority of that time being in my fridge. Nonetheless, this is a big beer, which comes together fairly nicely overall, for its elevated alcohol. It definitely becomes nice and smooth once the constituent flavours have had a chance to mingle.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=biboergosum#review"">Aug 02, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jlindros.163147/"">jlindros</a></b> from Massachusetts</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.12</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25</span><br/><br/>So I either somehow missed reviewing this, or it got lost in a server crash. Either way this is long overdue. And now cans, yay! Canned 1/29/19<br/>
Pours with a giant foamy creamy 2+ finger off-white head, great retention and some lacing, very clear golden-orange slight amber color<br/>
<br/>
Nose good balance of big hops and sweet malts, candy like toasty malts, little grainy-sweet with some cracker and a little white bread crusts, with big hops, earthy spicy and piney, with a background citrus note<br/>
<br/>
Taste again big sweet malts out front, candy notes without being syrupy, toasty grainy and more bread crust like but not quite Maillard just grainy sweet, then hops with medium-high bitterness, spicy flavor with a bit of pine and earthy, touch of citrus and grapefruit zest, candied orange marmalade like, finish attempts to dry but still a bit sticky sweet, some alcohol kicks in on the drying with lingering sweet malts and piney earthy hops, as well as more orange marmalade, but all balanced nicely<br/>
<br/>
Mouth is med to fuller bod, higher fluffy carb, a bit of warming alcohol<br/>
<br/>
Overall quite nice, I think my original review like 10 years ago would have been higher as IPAs especially have changed a lot since then, but this is still a nice IPA, good balance, nice hop and malt characters, well done<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=jlindros#review"">May 07, 2019</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/sammy.3853/"">Sammy</a></b> from Canada (ON)</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.05</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-5.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>A unique experience from beginning throughout.

<br/>
Smell: The grapefruit hops is the first thing that hits you; take a deeper whiff and some other odors break through, such as pine, brandy and a bit of toffee<br/>
<br/>
Taste: Although the hop profile is unmistakable, this is actually somewhat sweet; starts out with toffee and grapefruit; builds into a bit of brandy soaked raisins in the middle; in the finish, the hops return to close the deal, subsuming everything else other than a touch of sweet toffee on the tip of the tongue<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel: Fairly thick for an IPA; syrupy and oily with a modest amount of carbonation<br/>

They originally did this by hooking and old ""electric football"" game above the kettle and adding hops to the top of it. As it vibrated, the hops were slowly shaken off the edge. Unfortunately, (since it makes such a great story and everyone has fond memories of electric football) it got sprayed with water and never ran again! Now they've got a slow moving auger. The 90 minute is available in bottle (and draft at the brewpub), but the 60 minute is draft only (update - 12 oz. bottles were added in March 2003!). It has an impressive hop aroma but I kind of expected more. The malt is very basic in flavor (not very caramelish), but rich with a good body. Thankfully, it's enough to handle the intense hop flavors. There's alot of yeast character including an apricot fruitiness. The alcohol is a bit on the high side but it may smooth out if aged. The bitterness is there. Really there. As one local beer writer said, ""Feel the burn"". Definitely on the edge!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=NeroFiddled#review"">Jul 22, 2002</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/chinchill.199175/"">chinchill</a></b> from South Carolina</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.16</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-3.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25</span><br/><br/>served in pint glass.

<br/>
Crystal clear golden hue, with moderate off-white head. Head has average retention, although the ample carbonation makes for a long-lasting top coat. <br/>
<br/>
This is an intensely hoppy beer with a very high IBU (90!). It has a readily detectable malt component, landing a hint of honey but only enough sweetness to partially counter the hops, leaving a pronounced bitterness that's typical strength for the style. Hop flavor starts piney and ends with grapefruit but less bitterness than expected thanks to a generous malt load. Nice hoppy finish and aftertaste. <br/>
<br/>
Aroma, is fresh and floral, with piney and herbal hops dominating. <br/>

Always a treat!<br/>
<br/>
A finger of soapy, foamy head upon presentation. Color was a slightly cloudy orangish-amber. Nose was MUCH pine-ier than the previous DFH 60"" which I had just finished. Now, we're talkin'! The touch of this liquid to my tongue was that of an iron fist enrobed in velvet. A soft stroking motion followed by a studded punch of mail. Yoi! It was even silkier than the 60"", but the hops were NOT playing around. LOTS o' hops just simply assaulting my poor, defenseless taste buds which hadn't done anything to incur this sort of wrath. <br/>
<br/>
Now cue a quote from Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"": ""More, please, sir."" ""MORE?!? You want MORE!?!"" it seemed to roar back at me.<br/>
<br/>
I could merely gently nod as the tears openly rolled down my cheeks and my breath came in raspy gasps. Say, bartender ...<br/>
<br/>
Finish? I was finished. Ask any of the other Cask Night attendees.<br/>
<br/>
Cask Night saw it return several months later and this is what I wrote on that occasion:<br/>
<br/>
It was on gravity-pour this night so its head was just foam that de-ceded into nothingness, just a ring around the circumference. My glass evinced the deepest, clearest amber this side of orange of anything that I tried that evening. Clarity? NE, doubled. Bright! Edison would have wept. Mouthfeel was slightly full with a pronounced heat on the tongue. I started to feel like Goldilocks - one was too mild, this one was too much. Finish was hoppy, but indescribably so - I got bitter, but not in any way that I could pinpoint. <br/>
<br/>
I feel like a waffle - I used to love 60"", then I hit upon 90"" and now I prefer 75"".

Pours a dark orange, almost red. Almost clear. 1 inch head, strong lacing.<br/>
<br/>
Smells like citrus zest, brown sugar, pine, and alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
The 90 minutes of hopping provide tastes like pine needles, orange rind, and hash oil. The strong, almost overpowing malt bill brings flavors of caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, and molasses. The malts are too strong, to be honest, and too sweet- they drown out the hops, and keep the beer from being dry.<br/>
<br/>
Sticky, syrupy mouthfeel. Well carbonated.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people call this a balanced DIPA. I disagree- I think it is unbalanced towards the malt.

A: Three finger head of nice cream, good thickness, and good retention - especially for the ABV. Semitransparent copper colour. <br/>
<br/>
Sm: Strong bittering hops are dominant. Little else trickles in. Moderate strength aroma. It's pleasant and welcome. <br/>

<br/>
Mf: Smooth and wet, suiting the flavours. Nicely complementary. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Poured lightly yielding 1/2 finger head. Slightly off-white. Color is a clear light copper gold. Good lace retention. Leaves some light splattered lace. Nothing to exciting.<br/>
<br/>
Aroma: Very sharp floral hops. A lot lighter citrus than I would have expected. There is a burnt hops or a caramel blend going on here. Very light for 9% abv.<br/>
<br/>
Taste: Very malty for a hop bomb. Citrusy, but sweet. Burnt caramel, like the smell. A lot of floral and earthy hops. Can't really taste the 9%. After the beer warms a bit, I taste some honey.<br/>

Mouthfeel: Very bitter, but very smooth at the same time. Medium bodied. Medium level of carbonation. Leaves the typical hoppy aftertaste. A little booze comes through here. Very typical mouthfeel. Not to bad for a big DIPA. <br/>

<br/>
The appearance was typical: some light lace on the glass, very little head; dark copper color; clear<br/>
<br/>
The aromas were muted given the high hop volume. Most notable unusual smell: a touch of lemon.<br/>
<br/>
This is a big flavor beer. I like how balanced the beer is considering it is an Imperial IPA. There is enough malt to counter the high hop. I think this how an IIPA should taste.

There is a musty, raisiny, unidentifiable funk, almost like wet rug. There is so much hype surrounding this beer, but I don't get it. I'm not one of those people that thinks increasing the quantity of ingredients and boil time is the best route for IPAs.<br/>
<br/>
60 minute is a simple, restrained, yet in your face aromatic IPA, and is much better than this.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Pours light bronze with a creamy 1"" white head. Settles down to a tight 1/8"" head. Good head retention and lacing<br/>
<br/>
Smell: Hopapollooza. Floral and fruity hops and then hint of maltiness vanish behind the hops<br/>
<br/>
Taste: Much sweetness up front assailed by piney &amp; fruity hops. Dryness, alcohol and fruitiness on the finish<br/>
<br/>
Love the blance of this and carbonation is spot on<br/>

<br/>
Into a fluted Ommegang glass, a good pour results in two fingers of foam and a convex puff that threatens to spill over. High-clarity reddish amber jewel tone. <br/>
<br/>
Aroma is fairly subdued, a bit herbal and vegetal, with some underlying citrus like dried grapefruit rinds. <br/>
<br/>
Lush mouthfeel, palate-coating and fully enveloping.That's really it's finest quality. Slightly sticky sweet. Strong and dry in the finish, a little spicy, more than a hint of the high abv. There's an underlying chalky &amp; herbal aftertaste. The flavor has the obligatory pine and citrus, certainly full-flavored, but not pushing the envelope to me. It's huge and hoppy, but doesn't stand above the pack of other IIPA's out there.<br/>

Taste, sweet. Its a pretty standard beer, which is a surprise for DFH. There's some hops and bitterness that clearly establish this as an ipa. There isn't a bunch of weird adjuncts. Some pine, a ton of malt and caramel. <br/>

Smell: Lavish, rich caramel maltiness with pronounced accents of pine, juicy citrus fruits, and dried pineapple. <br/>

Taste: The malt and hops march side-by-side along the tongue with lush sugary caramel sweetness and pineapple juice garnished with pine needles.

S: Strong hops and citrus aroma, with some caramelized malt mixed in, very pleasant. <br/>

M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium-to-high carbonation, very clean finish, nicely balanced. <br/>

M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. <br/>

O: The higher ABV in this beer is pretty well hidden.

Straight down the middle pour into a Nonick pint glass gives a wonderful creamy off white brown head of four fingers. Head is very creamy and fluffy it looks right our of the tap. Great burnt orange amber body, clear with zero visible carbonation.<br/>
<br/>
Small malt, a good bit of bread, and of course some smelling hoppy ness. A very subtle nose and some type of sweet hard candy. Much more varied than I expected. Good but still all very subtle.<br/>
<br/>
Dense malt and orange coat the palate, mouthfeel is big bold and DENSE without being syrupy. Orange citrus washes my mouth and no hint of boozyness. Good balance of taste, with a hint of sweet malt in the finish, lingering but not overpowering hop bitters, and orange zest and flesh goodness.<br/>

- old review from 5-18-2008<br/>
<br/>
A clear consistency of bronze hue, with sharp hops on the nose.<br/>
<br/>
Light bodied, but has a very long finish. The mouthfeel is not as dense as I was expecting and seemed very thin. Great bouquet and high hop consistency seems balanced on the nose, but it's thin body seems to pull more of the alcohol out instead of the flavors. Overall though still very good.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=Smakawhat#review"">Feb 25, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/buckeyenation.3819/"">BuckeyeNation</a></b> from Iowa</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.2</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Brightly polished tangerine-amber with honey colored accents, topped by a thick, creamy head of rich ivory that is tacky enough to stick around, seemingly indefinitely, and to leave an impressive lace legacy when it eventually departs.<br/>
<br/>
Even though the brewery calls it an IPA, there's little doubt that 90 Minute is a DIPA and a good one. The nose is full of bright, brassy citric hops with a sweet caramel maltiness swirled into the mix. Specific fruits include orange, grapefruit and apricot.<br/>
<br/>
This is definitely powerful stuff. Some breweries create DIPAs with a relative emphasis on malt so that there's as much caramel flavor as hoppiness. Others place a relative emphasis on hops in order to produce a tongue-shredding, bitter, explosive hop monster. This beer looks like the latter, but tastes like the former. Trouble is, I prefer the latter.<br/>
<br/>
There's still a lot to like here. The flavor profile is an amalgam of melted caramel, fermented pine sap, concentrated essence of oily citrus peel and alcohol. The alcohol masking--like a few other DFH beers that I've had--is more like those small black 'eye masks' than a full-faced Godzilla mask. That is, it's not that hard to appreciate what's underneath.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is an old bottle (although I don't believe that it is) and the hops have softened too much. Running it through Randall the Enamel Animal should fix it right up, but I don't have one handy at the moment. Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA is still good-very good beer, but it doesn't quite crack my upper tier.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=BuckeyeNation#review"">Nov 22, 2004</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/tmoney2591.322390/"">TMoney2591</a></b> from Illinois</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.05</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-5.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Served in a shaker pint glass at the VH WhirlyBall.<br/>

It's been a while since I've indulged in one o' these bad boys. It pours a clear copper-amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises mandarin oranges, grapefruit (both ruby red and ... yellow?), light pine, sweet caramel, and a pinch of powdered sugar. The taste holds notes of strong orange peel and grapefruit; this sits atop a mountain of rich, sweet caramel, providing a lovely dichotomy for my 'buds. The body is a wavering medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly sticky feel. Overall, a very nice DIPA, one of the standards of the industry.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=TMoney2591#review"">Dec 27, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/clayrock81.170415/"">clayrock81</a></b> from Florida</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.28</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-0.5%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>For an IPA it poured very thick and had a stout like head. A dense, red tinted brown was in my glass, covered by three-finger head that slowly dissipated and left a complete ring of laces as I drank down the cup. A very hoppy smell does pertrude, of course, but there seemes to be a little hint of sweetness, like caramel or honey or some fruitiness (I can't think of a distinct one though). Also some malt in the smell, and there is bread/coffee malt, or something of that kin, in this beer. There is of course a spiciness to this beer because there is an incredible amount of hops. Unlike some heavy duty IPA's, though, this retains a fullish body that is smooth and flavorful (a little citric) with a dry but not overdone backbite. I am not a big hophead, but if I were I could probably identify the numerous hops they must've put in this brew. Very balanced, and the 9% ABV is hidden well. A great beer whose sessionability is only limited by price and high ABV. A must have for any beer drinker to try, not just IPA fans.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=clayrock81#review"">Apr 19, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/mikesgroove.104485/"">mikesgroove</a></b> from South Carolina</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.63</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+7.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Pours a beautiful clear, amber with a 1 finger head that stayed around for a while, and laced up the whole glass.

12 oz. Bottle<br/>
Bottled On: 11/03/16<br/>
<br/>
Probably close to 4 years since the last time I had this brew.<br/>
<br/>
Pours a very nice clean/clear dark golden orangy color, very nice carbonation, with a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger off-white head, which also leaves a nice size oil slick and some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is mostly malty, sweet, with some hops. The taste is sweet, malty, nice little hop note, and slightly spicy. Medium body, ABV hidden very well. Nice little dry/bitter finish. Overall I adjusted my score again, too accordingly give this beer a review for what this beer is worth on it's own.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks goes out to richardflyr for this in person trade.<br/>

This beer is totally different from the last few times I had it and the original review. I just had to write a more current review.<br/>
<br/>
Pours a nice clean/clear golden light amber color, nice carbonation, with a little fizzy white head, which does leave some sticky lacing behind. The nose is mostly malty, sweet, with some hops. The taste is sweet, malty, nice little hop note, and slightly spicy. Medium body, ABV still hidden very well. Overall I had to bring these points down, this is just a medicore DIPA to me now.<br/>
<br/>
WOW this beer is awesome. Pours a clear golden yellow, not much of a head, but leaves some nice lacing. This beer has an different scent than other IPAs I've had, barley, hops, nutty, fruity, and spicy. The scent hits you the second you open the bottle. I really like the taste, kinda sweet with a little bite at the end. The body is light. For a 9% ABV beer you would never know it, Dogfish Head hid the alcohol very well. This is a very highly recommended brew.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=Wasatch#review"">Sep 03, 2005</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/tigg924.215811/"">tigg924</a></b> from Massachusetts</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.62</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-15.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 3.5</span><br/><br/>Appearance: amber, clear carbonated, medium head<br/>

The result is a dark caramel color with two fingers of a fluffy white head and some nice carbonation.<br/>
<br/>
S: The smell is much more of a mix of hops and citrus than our West Coast IPAs. A nice balance of citrus and pine hops along with a sweet, caramel malt backbone.<br/>
<br/>
T: The hop flavor is mostly bitter grapefruit. There is also a very strong malt component that has a very roasted, yet sweet flavor. The finish is a bit of pine and some more grapefruit.<br/>
<br/>
M: This is actually quite full bodied, but that's not too surprising for a double IPA. The tiny carbonation bubbles help to keep things from getting too heavy.<br/>
<br/>
D: For a 9% beer, this is surprisingly lacking in the booziness department (and a welcome change from certain other DFH beers). That said, I still find it hard to stray from our West Coast IPAs which are just so much more hop-centric.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=brokensail#review"">Dec 01, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/tone.106332/"">Tone</a></b> from Missouri</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.47</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+4%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Pours a clear, dark golden color. 1/2 inch head of a off-white color.

Aroma: BAM! Whoppity-snappityBAM!BOOM!BAM!, that's the full force of the pine up in there, the intense grapefruit, all the citric flavor that embarks on the senses and nevers flags for a second, grassy, herbal, potent, totally hoppy, sprucey, piney, pineappley, so much going on in this nose!<br/>
But, to taste...Ah! A wonderful mess here, a big, mix of hops and citric fruity flavor, the punchy pine on the palate, yum, yum, yum. If you're not sufficiently infatuated with humulous lupus, sit this one out, by all means. A big, sticky, fruity, citric mouthfeel, and, yeah, there's grapefruit, but so much more.

Pours a clear orange with 1 finger head that hangs around until the beverage is nearly all. Also has a bunch of lacing all around the glass. Aroma is nice and hoppy, plenty of floral and citrus hop scent along with some sweetness in the nose. Taking a sip, you are welcomed by the hops but it is not overloaded in bitterness considering it is an Imperial IPA. There is also a nice amount of malty sweetness about the taste as well. Carbination is perfect, mouthfeel is medium. Alcohol is not fully present until the finish and even that is misleading to think that this is 9%. Well done. <br/>

<br/>
The smell has nice grapefruit aroma with some spicy notes and a bit of sweet malt.<br/>
<br/>
The taste on first sip is very citrusy(grapefruit &amp; lemon) giving it good hop bitterness but it's balanced by a strong backbone of caramel malt and boy, does that work for this DIPA. Further sips in and the malt actually becomes the dominant feature of this brew and the warming from the alcohol also starts to play a part. Ahhh...this is great stuff. I'm so pleased Colorado is a distribtion point for Dogfish Head beers.<br/>
<br/>
More sips in and it's like a seesaw ride. First the malt is dominant, then the hops are. I have to say, for a 9%abv brew, this one's drinkability factor is outstanding! <br/>
<br/>
I'm just finishing what's left in my glass and I couldn't have enjoyed *any* DIPA more. So much taste and yet, so damn smooth and easy drinking. World class brew imho.<br/>

The aroma indicated citrus hop smells and malt notes.<br/>
<br/>
The taste came across with a malt sweetness with a bitter bite. It finished clean and dry with a noticeable alcohol character.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, this is highly respectable IPA.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=beergoot#review"">Jan 29, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/mdfb79.414386/"">mdfb79</a></b> from New York</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.12</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>From 10/18/10 notes.

a - Pours a nice golden-amber color with an inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident.<br/>
<br/>
s - Smells strongly of citrus, pine, and floral hops. Very enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
t - Tastes of bitter citrus hops, some pine hops, fruit malts, caramel and bready malts. Some bitterness in the taste, but not a crazy amount.<br/>
<br/>
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation.<br/>

d - A great DIPA that is around year round and I've had many times. Fresh it is a great beer and the smell is wonderful.

<br/>
Appearance: rich golden-orange hue with a crystal-clear body. Head is two solid fingers of bubbly light-tan foam. It's making me thirsty already.<br/>
<br/>
Smell: big earthy/funky hop aroma against what smells like a biscuity malt background. I like it well enough, though I'm not in love with the biscuit.<br/>
<br/>
Taste: big, rich malt flavor with a deep and complex hop character. The malt is thick and, though less biscuity than the aroma, has a bit of that quality to it. Hops start of with a bit of a bite and then transform to a funky headiness. At the end is a rich bitterness which works very well. I like it.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel: medium-thick body with a level of carbonation which seems high to me for the style (though I like a good carb, so it works for me). The overall textural effect is rather refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
Drinkability: this is a pretty drinkable beer overall, but I find the hops a little too jarring to be really refreshing. That, plus the slightly-overly-biscuity malt bill detract a bit from this beer's drinkability. It's still quite good, though.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=flagmantho#review"">Jul 03, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/defencorps.117609/"">DefenCorps</a></b> from Oregon</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.35</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+1.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>12oz bottle poured into my Duvel tulip.

<br/>
A: Clear orange-tinged hue. Slight effervescence, decent sized head and lacing.<br/>
<br/>
S: Malt, then hops, with very little grapefruit, citrus, pine, etc. I have always thought that this beer is too malt heavy and lacks the classic hop aromas I expect from a DIPA.<br/>
<br/>
T: The beer tastes fine, I suppose, but I always find myself a little underwhelmed when drinking 90 minute IPA. The ""balance"" of malts and hops heavily favors the malt, and leaves me yearning for that big hop aroma and taste so indicative of the style. I really have to shift my paradigm when I drink 90 minute IPA, and think of it more as a big ale, rather than a DIPA.<br/>
<br/>
M: Sticky and sweet, with a malty and bitter aftertaste.<br/>
<br/>
D: A decent brew, and easy to come by. <br/>
<br/>
Notes: This beer ages rather well, and becomes something completely different. I cellared a case of 90 minute IPA for two years. The beer developed a molasses, caramel sweetness, the hop profile drastically faded, and the beer basically turned into an American Strong Ale. Interesting, if nothing else.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=Huhzubendah#review"">Apr 04, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/guyfawkes.590591/"">GuyFawkes</a></b> from Illinois</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.6</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75</span><br/><br/>Bottled 4/11/14; drank 5/13/14 @ the Palace. <br/>

The flavor was bold as the hops were all over the tastebuds, but were also balance with a thick malt. Some orange was detected during the taste but was minor to the hops and malt. The malt rode the tongue long, and the only thing that outran it was the bitterness. Bitterness was evident 2 minutes after swallowing. <br/>

The mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, slick and creamy. You can notice the alcohol in this beer, but it's not overpowering. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth even with the high ABV.

<br/>
A - Very clear medium dark amber w/ weak pale head, no lacing and looks basically uncarbonated<br/>
<br/>
S - Sweet malt aroma w/ high tart amarilllo sour citrus scent. The odor is moderately high of alcohol and he hops are not as pungent as expected but nice scent overall<br/>
<br/>
M - I got the fruitiness and sweet malt in the feel w/ intense bite of bitterness and alcohol simultaneously w/ a residual sweet texture and juicy hop finish<br/>
<br/>
T - Sweet - high amount of sweetness w/ the two row evident in the taste w/ a mild nutty toasted malt taste. The flavor is almost more like a barleywine until a citrusy amarillo and lemony hop flavor w/ sour oranges and mild sweet taste eases in. The malt is candy-like w/ tangerines and tangy notes w/ a boozy flavor that lasts into the finish<br/>
<br/>
D - A drinkable Imperial IPA, especially on cask, but it seems stronger and more intense, not the same beer as in the bottle at all. I hope to have it on cask again to compare, but a great experience that seems to expose how malty the beer really is. Just a bit over the top for everday drinking or to be social. I would probably have ordered only a half pint next time - strength and acidity are too much for my taste this way.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=Slatetank#review"">May 31, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jason.3/"">Jason</a></b> from Massachusetts</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.18</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Presentation: 12 oz bottle with a freshness date.<br/>
<br/>
Appearance: With the massive amount of hops I expect nothing less than a superb lace and that is what I got. A solid ring after every sip ... amazing. Slightly hazed bronze gold color the haze is most likely from the hops.<br/>
<br/>
Smell: Fresh hop aroma, very oily with herbal and piney notes. Ripe fruity esters and some sweet malt in the back.<br/>
<br/>
Taste: This beer is so juicy, what a hop punch it has. Lots of bitterness and a ton of hop oil flavor from front to back. Very smooth with a thick malty body. Nice cake like maltiness in the middle with a ripe fruit and alcoholic kick in the end, finishes a little sweet with lingering bitter hop tones.<br/>

So when I got to Binny's today and saw a batch from 11/04/09 I was stoked. Served in my Kuhnhenn tulip.<br/>
<br/>
A - Pours with a gorgeous 2+ fingers of light tan foam that takes forever to dissipate to a thick cap (I timed it at around 6 minutes). The lacing coats the sides of the glass. Gorgeous transparent golden amber body with a stream of tiny bubbles racing up the middle of the glass.<br/>
<br/>
S - A big burst of pine and grapefruit hoppiness over a strong toasted malt and toffee backbone. Maybe a bit of sweeter citrus zest, tangerine or orange. The aroma exemplifies the prototypical East Coast balanced DIPA, with both elements of the brew complementing each other and working in tandem. There's the tiniest hint of alcohol, but nowhere near as much as when I had this beer on tap a few months ago.<br/>
<br/>
T - The taste is significantly less hop forward, with a initial burst of bitter grapefruit followed by a long sustained dose of toffee and cookie dough. The finish is lightly bitter, with a bit of pine and grapefruit again popping up in the aftertaste. Alcohol is again reasonably well-hidden.<br/>
<br/>
M - Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with low carbonation. Body is definitively medium, and could stand to be a touch more viscous to support the ABV. There's some definite warming, even after half a glass. Finishes very oily and resiny.<br/>
<br/>
D - The only thing really preventing me from drinking large quantities of this brew is the ABV, as well as the difficulty in finding fresh bottles. I've inadvertently purchased older bottles in the past (before I knew of the date-codes), or had this from old kegs, and it gets boozy and underwhelming pretty fast. I'm not sure who's at fault, but until I can reliably find bottles less than 6 weeks old this ain't getting more than a 4.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=MasterSki#review"">Nov 25, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jmdrpi.276070/"">jmdrpi</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+4.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>had on-tap, through Randall the Enamel Animal filled with fresh hops. <br/>

Aromas of grapefruit and pear, with a heavy dose of tangy hops, with a lemon-peppered like spice to it. Flavors are very well balanced, with citrus-pear sweet tones once again, balanced with a peppery, roasted hops character that takes over the palate. The sweetness and the round body keep the hops from being too dry, and the carbonation level keeps it light and crisp. Great lace cling on the glass.

<br/>
Appearance - A beautiful golden color with a small head upon pouring. The head fades not leaving much lacing.<br/>
<br/>
Smell - A wonderfully sweet tropical fruit smell first meets the nose. Very unexpected but very pleasant. This then mixes beautifully with a piney and floral hop aroma. Very nice.<br/>
<br/>
Taste - At first sweet malt and tropical fruit taste mixed with a mild floral hop flavor. The sweeter malt remains in flavor, but is soon overwhelmed by the hops which really step up their show, intensifying quite a bit with a burst of mostly piney and citrusy hop flavor.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel - A good body but a little on the think side actually. It is very drinkable however as it's carbonation is spot on. The thinner body make this 9% a little too easy to drink (good and bad at the same time).<br/>
<br/>
Overall - A very nice IPA it truly is. In my opinion a little over-hyped, but only a little.

T: The initial flavor was dry and spicy caramel, with a big citrus and pine hopping brought to live by the lively carbonation factor. The beer finishes spicy and dry with a floral hopping, a strong caramel presence as well some spicy alcohol fusels. The hopping and alcohol warming provide a nice lingering bitterness and warming to the finish.<br/>
<br/>
M: A warm dry spicy alcohol gently warms up the mouthful with a puckering bitterness of dry floral. <br/>
<br/>
D: A big hoppy treat balanced nicely against a huge sweet malty grain bill makes this a great drinking ipa with the abv% covered up rather nicely.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=beerthulhu#review"">Dec 19, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/buschbeer.295975/"">buschbeer</a></b> from Ohio</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.12</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>I poured into a pint glass to a nice creamy head.

<br/>
Half a pint poured into a stemmed tulip glass.<br/>
<br/>
The bar is fairly dark, but you can see this is a copper coloured beer with a thin white head on top without having to ask for extra lighting.<br/>
<br/>
The aroma was all hop, a fairly bitter hop aroma at that.<br/>
<br/>
The beer taste was predominately hops too, although a malty aftertaste appeared as the beer warmed in the glass, it got sweeter too, as it warmed.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the alcohol well hidden at first, but it did show towards the end of the tasting. It didn't become overpowering, but you could tell it was hanging around waiting to attack if you'd let it.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=BlackHaddock#review"">May 24, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jdhilt.84/"">jdhilt</a></b> from New Hampshire</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.3</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  <span class=""muted"">rDev 0%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Good carbonation and head, leaves a good lace.

A-Copper color with a nice head on it. Expecting big things the first time I tried it.<br/>
<br/>
S-Sweet and malty with some alcohol scent. Lacks the hop aroma the most DIPA's have. <br/>
<br/>
T- I love dem hops and this beer does not deliver in this category. Very sweet and malty. Once again...Where are the hops? Too sweet for my taste. Alcohol is quite present.<br/>
<br/>
M-The mouthfeel is pretty good but I still can't give it a high rating because I don't love the taste. Well carbonated and thick but the flavor makes the feel of this beer less than stellar.<br/>
<br/>
D- Not very drinkable. I've bot a few four packs of this brew hoping to surprise myself and actually like it. Each time I have trouble choking back more than two of these bastards.<br/>

Tasted similar to the nose with some more alcohol bite. Caramel rules the day here. So smooth.<br/>

The smell is a triumph of fresh hop, very grassy, with grape-fruit notes. <br/>

Sure enough, this lived up to the hype, although it was not the ""hopbomb"" that I was expecting. As odd as it sounds, this beer has a nice taste that's both subtle and refined. The hops are there but they don't hit you over the head. Instead, they're present, solid, and addicting. Needless to say, I wish I had more than one bottle in front of me.<br/>
<br/>
Good pour to this - clear, dark amber, and bubbly with a fairly frothy head. It almost reminded me of a west coast IPA like Stone or Sierra Nevada because of the amount of carbonation that could be seen. Like those beers, that didn't necessarily translate over to the taste. What did stick out was the sudsy, leathery, dry-hopped aspect of this. It's only a bit floral and citrusy but the warmer, metallic notes dominate more. The body is near perfect and this won't leave you wishing for a glass of water by your side to wash it down. Now that I've worked my way down to the bottom of my pint glass, I can certainly taste a bit of bourbon and caramel in this. What exactly what this aged in?!?!??<br/>
<br/>
Sure, this is 9.00% ABV but it'll go down so easily that it can hardly be felt. Just give this a shot and enjoy it - Dogfish Head is arguably the best East Coast Brewery at putting these kind of beers together and this proves why beyond the shadow of a doubt. Instead of overloading the senses, this puts the ""craft"" into craft beer. While it's not the best I've ever had, it's up there and can more than hold it's own. All that's left for me to sample now are their other IPA's - this beer has made me thirst for those, it's that good!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=JerzDevl2000#review"">May 23, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/halcyondays.145116/"">Halcyondays</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.68</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-14.4%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 3</span><br/><br/>12 oz. bottle, <br/>

A: Golden amber, with a thick white head, with very good retention.<br/>
<br/>
S: Boozy, fruits of golden raisins, honey, and some grapes, very winey in a way.<br/>
<br/>
T: Different than what I was expecting. Light fruity tastes, with a clear alcohol profile. Brandyish and phenolic. Tastes a lot like the 120 minute with a lot less alcohol, clearly very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
M: I happen to like the mouthfeel a lot. Smooth, very smooth from the ethanol, creamy, almost medicinal.<br/>
<br/>
D: This beer is strange, I thought it tasted a lot more like a barleywine than a 2IPA.

Head is insane and the lacing is amazing - it leaves wonderful patches down the glass just from the slight dissipation of the head. Bubbles don't know what to do to punch their way out through the body, but they make a valiant effort. Looks wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Big piney, almost solvent like pungency on the nose. Pepper, latex, resin, citrus rind and acetone all bubbling and gurgling together in some insane witches' brew of powerful aromas. Oh so grand for an IPA - hoppy up the hilt.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, before you even get a dose of those lovely hops, that heavy belting richness makes its presence felt, with a slick, thick, chewy texture coating the mouth. Once it's there it releases its bomb - a phenomenally astringent hop bitterness cascading over the tongue. Apart from the thick body, there's almost no whisper of the malt backing, but that's ok. That's what this beer is all about.<br/>
<br/>
It's a big hop-bomb this one, almost to the point of insanity. It teeters oh so close to the edge of being irredeemable, but stays gloriously on our side of the realm.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=lacqueredmouse#review"">May 25, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/thesixthring.252427/"">TheSixthRing</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.33</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+0.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25</span><br/><br/>Bottled on date of 11/20/12<br/>
<br/>
Appearance - Pours a hazy, bright golden orange color with an off-white, finger width head. Average retention. <br/>
<br/>
Smell - Pungent caramel malt complexity highlights the aroma. Hops take a backseat, but come across as floral and a touch of pine.<br/>
<br/>
Taste - Strong malt complexity upfront - caramel and bread smack you in the mouth and don't hold back. Hops pop up mid-taste and are floral, with a slight hint of pine. Finish is well-balanced and clean, allowing for drink after drink; almost quaffable.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel - Medium to full body, with moderate carbonation. Creamy, smooth and entirely drinkable.<br/>
<br/>
Overall - I really love this beer. Easily my favorite DFH beer to date. I'd love to try one that's less than a month old, because 3 months in, I feel like this one has maybe lost a bit of it's hop sheen. Even if that's the case, this is still a monster of a beer, one that I will be buying again in the near future.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=TheSixthRing#review"">Feb 18, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/barnzy78.224763/"">barnzy78</a></b> from Illinois</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.18</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>12oz bottle<br/>

T - Super smooth and malty; wow! Yeah, it's a hop bomb, but the balance is maybe the best I've ever had in an IPA. Huge, huge malt profile, but nothing undesirable at all. Creamy. Citrus and pulp. Absolutely amazing.<br/>
<br/>
M - I repeat: smooth and creamy. A bit of alcohol and carbonation sting, but very drinkable. Cloying as the beer warms slightly.<br/>
<br/>
O - This beer surprised me. I've had DFH 60, and I kind of expected a hoppier version. While technically true, the amazing balance with the huge malt load absolutely shocked me.<br/>

<br/>
A: The ale is amber brown, darn near indistunguishable from an amber bottle. As light shines through, a brilliant clarity emerges showing off no imperfections. To top the whole appearance off, a thick band of lace dries throughout the glass as I consume it. <br/>
<br/>
S: The nose is citrusy goodness, all hops and no filler. The aromas are intense and can't hide the big alcohol that supports all those hops.<br/>
<br/>
T: First sip is cringe-worthy. The hops are so strong that they easily overwhelm the tastebuds. Their flavor is cirusy, full of grapefruit, tangerine and orange peel flavors. The bitterness defines the whole taste, hoppy from start to finish. The hops are matched, almost dollar-for-dollar against hot alcoholic heat. The malt body doesn't make much noise, serving only to support the hops. This is a hophead's salvation.<br/>
<br/>
M: The malts lack a backbone, adding a measure of balance to the ale only. That's okay though because the hop profile is big and delicious, with citrus notes making their presence known early on. This beer is a perfect representative of the American style of brewing.<br/>
<br/>
D: The alcohol body is huge but the hop profile is revolutionary. This is, to me, one of the early entrants in the American IPA market (double, single or triple even). It is a gold standard and worth a sip, especially if it is fresh.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=akorsak#review"">Sep 16, 2007</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/bb1313.349757/"">BB1313</a></b> from Ohio</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.16</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-3.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Bottled on 9/2/10.. had this one a few nights ago; poured into a standard pint glass.

The taste is pretty malty for a DIPA, but the hops do balance it out. There's also a slight caramel presense, maybe toffee as well. The mouthfeel is has a slight resin feel, but remains smooth; full-bodied. Drinkability is good, although this one can catch up to you. The aromas have you coming back for more.<br/>

A beer whose appearance says “Drink me!” and doesn’t disappoint. This beer is about the hops and they shine through.

Nice lingering bitterness. Definitely not as overpowering as 120 Minute IPA but for some reason, I prefer the 60 Minute IPA over this. <br/>
<br/>
Still not too bad for an Imperial IPA. could use more malt balance.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=Brad007#review"">Oct 25, 2007</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/barczar.397246/"">barczar</a></b> from Kentucky</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.2</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Reviewing 60, 75, and 90 minute side-by-side.<br/>
<br/>
Pours a slightly hazed golden caramel color, substantially darker than the 75 minute. A soft, pillowy half inch cream head dissipates quickly in comparison, leaving small lacing around the rim. <br/>
<br/>
Caramel malts are hugely dominant in the aroma in comparison with the 60 and 75. There's a bready sweetness and a boozy character that initially mask the hops. At the back of the nose, though, grapefruit, pine, earthiness, and fresh cut grass are detectable. As it warms, the hops become more pronounced. Dank, skunky notes emerge.<br/>
<br/>
Flavor is much sweeter and boozier than the 60 and 75. Caramel malt sweetness is present throughout the profile. Dank hops, along with citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine, underlie the malt character. The hop flavors linger into the finish more so than in the 60 and 75, as well. The finish reprises a bit of the bready malt character, and there's more bitterness. As it warms, the citrus really emerges and shows that the 90 really does have more hop character.<br/>
<br/>
Body is fairly thick and slightly syrupy, with carbonation significantly lower than the 60 and 75. There's a lot more alcohol warmth.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the balance is more difficult to figure out in this brew. Extreme in both malt and hop character, as a dipa should be. Very sweet in comparison to the other two, but still enough hops to give the palate a proper beating.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/64/2093/?ba=barczar#review"">Dec 21, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/arrogantb.82886/"">ArrogantB</a></b> from Colorado</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.61</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-16%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5</span><br/><br/>12 oz bottle scored for 8$ a four-pack.

<br/>
Its confident copper pour is heady and long-lasting with its froth, delivering high hop aroma early and often. With just enough of a tepid caramel and crusted bread support to balance its hop flavor, a medley of citrus and tropical fruit waft about in a highly perfumed scent and early taste than hinges on... dare I say- bubblegum?<br/>
<br/>
While the malts drop out as the beer crosses the middle, the hop character protrudes- steering from its fragrant bouquet and capturing the gleaming taste of red grapefruit, straight from the orchard. Ripe, vibrant and juicy citrus is woven together with delicate fructose candied sweetness, tangerine and tropical mango with a hint of marmalade.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing its developing taste, the hops trend dry, resinous and smoothly bitter- resembling the taste of severed pine needles to and fro. With the hops outlasting the malts with ease, the finish is refreshingly dry and bitter with echoes of perfume in aftertaste.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=BEERchitect#review"">Jul 02, 2014</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/uclabrewn84.439438/"">UCLABrewN84</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.17</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Thanks to kzoobrew for sending me this one!<br/>

Pours a hazy golden yellow-orange with a 1 inch puffy white head that fades to a film. Thin broken rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down.

This beer pours a slightly hazy medium golden yellow hue, with two fat fingers of tight foamy, creamy off-white head, which leaves random swaths of sticky, filmy lace around the glass as it slowly recedes. It smells of bready caramel cream, and citrus, herbal, and mild pine hops. The taste is more of the same - though the citrus hops wane, replaced by a growing herbal essence, and bitter, all, over a mildly sweet bready malt. No evidence of the 7 points of booze, which is nice. The carbonation is on the low side of average, and a wee bit airy, the body also just short of medium weight, and smooth enough against a surging bitter hop edge. It finishes clean, mostly, and hoppy - the green, grassy, herbal sort.<br/>
<br/>
A pretty decent IPA - I'm suspecting one of two things: this bottle has a bit of age on it, or my palate is still wrecked from two weeks of drinking in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho...<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=biboergosum#review"">Jul 26, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jlindros.163147/"">jlindros</a></b> from Massachusetts</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+4.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Thanks again to portia99 for this tasty beverage.

<br/>
A: Golden yellow orange color with a little clarity, huuuuge head and shows no signs of fading as lots of carbonation is shooting up the edges of the glass<br/>
<br/>
N: Some light malts, touch of vanilla, a floral hop aroma with light citrus and candy hops, but not a huge hop nose bite, slight brown sugar<br/>
<br/>
T: Starts with a nice malty bread like base, creamy and rich, light toastiness, more floral hops shine through in the middle, light but still bitter, a touch of vanilla and sweet candy like taste round it off very well (I think this comes right from the malts), a slight juicy hop center adds a touch of pine and citrus, touch of spicy hop flavor, slight alcohol but barely, very slight fruit as well. It finishes semi dry with a great hop kick, the bitter hops hit pretty well at the end. The hops fade over time but have a great long lasting kick. A touch more sweet malts and floral hops also.<br/>
<br/>
M: Semi creamy and lots of carbonation, semi think as well<br/>
<br/>
Overall: This is almost perfect for an IPA. It starts with light hops and great malt backbone, finishes with a great bitter hop bite, a touch of pine and citrus as well as alcohol, some sweet candy malts and vanilla taste round it off well. Reminds me a lot of Burton Baton with a touch less malt, oak, alcohol, and bitter hops making it more drinkable but less oak and vanilla to round it off.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=jlindros#review"">Aug 22, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/sammy.3853/"">Sammy</a></b> from Canada (ON)</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.3</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  <span class=""muted"">rDev 0%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Excellent world class IPA.

It eventually drops but keeps a really nice creamy collar, and a simple swirl of the glass brings it right back up! Additionally, it leaves some nice lace - although it's fleeting. The aroma, however, is even more astonishing than the appearance with a bright, bold combination of soft ripe fruit, tangy grapefruit and resiny pine. Intense! But it goes even one step further as the flavor is even bolder than the aroma with a searing bitterness right-up front, and from start to finish! If it weren't for the rich (almost sugary) and fruity (apricot, tangerine, mild pineapple) malt underneath this beer would be way too much! Surprisingly, and thankfully, the hop flavors are limited to the fruity side of things and the interplay between the crushing bitterness and the sweet malt is really interesting. It's kind of like a ""tug of war"" in the mouth. The firm maltiness is enlivened by a very fine and gently effervescent carbonation that helps this to happen. It's surprisingly smooth and creamy. This is one hell of a ""take no prisoners"" IPA that should clearly be sought out and destroyed - one bottle at a time!

I got it wrong, initially. Those 5L mini-kegs actually qualify as CANs as long as they are unpressurized. It's okay, since I have had Two Hearted Ale in a number of forms, including bottle and cask, also, but now it is truly in a 16-oz. CAN. I scored it at Pinocchio's (@pinbeer) and I am excited to give it a whirl. The graphics are phenomenal and the name is an allusion to a Hemingway story, doubling my interest.<br/>
<br/>
From the CAN: ""An Ameri[CAN] India Pale Ale with intense hop aroma and malt balance. Well suited for adventurous trips anywhere.""; ""Unfilterered""; ""Best Kept Refrigerated""; ""Unpasteurized"". <br/>
<br/>
Man, was the Crack! loud! I immediately got an inverted Glug started, allowing the fish plenty of slack on the line to run. The pseudo-cascade quickly settled into two fingers of dense, tawny head with excellent retention in the face of tonight's humidity. Color was a hazy golden-yellow (SRM = &amp;gt; 5, &amp;lt; 7) and my old pals Croesus, Mammon and Midas suddenly appeared, clamoring for a taste. Forget it! This is all for me. The nose was big with hops, giving off scents of pine, grapefruit, pineapple and as a previous reviewer mentioned, lilac or lavender in a lightly perfume-y way. As I was typing, the head began to drop, leaving sticky lacing in its wake. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops were immediate and unrelenting on the tongue, but underlain with a sweet maltiness so as not to be overwhelming. Jesus, but this was tasty! The fact that it is now available in a more portable form of CAN really excites me. The finish was semi-dry, with the malt really achieving a good balance with the hops so that they do not become overwhelming. This deserves a place in anyone's cooler, no matter what their destination.<br/>

My original, on-tap, review dtd 02 June 2008 with all 5s follows:<br/>
<br/>
A mini-keg counts as ""on-tap"", does it not? If not, this will either get removed or moved to a more appropriate type.<br/>
<br/>
The pour produced a big, rocky, bone-white head with excellent retention. The nose had a great hoppy presence. The color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow. The mouthfeel was medium with a definite hop bite on the palate. The finish lingered with hops. There was great lacing produced throughout. This is unquestionably one of my favorite American IPAs of all time.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=woodychandler#review"">Jun 10, 2014</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/greesyfizeek.721957/"">GreesyFizeek</a></b> from New York</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.61</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+7.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>A real classic, first received in a trade a few years ago, then bottles bought at AJ's Beer Warehouse.

Pours a hazy glowing orange yellow. 1 inch head with great lacing.<br/>
<br/>
A big trifecta of great hop aromas- pine, citrus, floral.<br/>
<br/>
The tastes follows similarly, and successfully. Very floral up front, with some sweet citrus flavors mixed with bitter pine notes. The bitterness is lingering but not over-powering. Not much noticeable malt flavor. One of the freshest hop expressions on the market.<br/>

Light, crisp mouthfeel, light-to-medium body. Insanely drinkable.<br/>

I just reviewed Expedition Stout and was really disappointed, but I'm hoping this one is as good as it's meant to be. Here you go, Bell's, this is your second chance. Bottled 08/29/12. 7.0% ABV confirmed. Expectations are through the roof; I've hearing about this one for awhile. 355ml brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a goblet in Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. <br/>
<br/>
Served straight from the refrigerator. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. <br/>
<br/>
A: Pours a two finger frothy creamy beige head of good thickness and retention. Colour is a murky copper. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Looks like any standard IPA ought to. <br/>
<br/>
Sm: Floral, pine, and citrus (lemon) notes - in that order. Light soap. Even a bit of bubblegum. There's some pleasant clean malts lurking beneath the hops. The soap concerns me (I've brewed my fair share of too-long-in-primary IPAs), but I'm hoping it's good. An average strength aroma. <br/>
<br/>
T: Soap, clean malts, floral hops, more soap, some light grapefruit, and lemon on the finish. Imbalanced; the salty soap dominates. What's the hype about? Very underwhelming. It's clean, though, and it does hide its ABV well. No alcohol comes through. A bit salty on the climax; almost gose-esque. <br/>
<br/>
Mf: Smooth, wet, light, and not quite refreshing. Suits the flavours alright.<br/>
<br/>
Dr: Man, Bell's is pissing me off a bit. I don't get the hype about this brewery at all, and I've tried two of their higher rated brews. This one is so damn soapy it's hard to enjoy. Get rid of the soap and then we'll talk, Bell's. What a disappointment. Drinkable, but pedestrian at best. <br/>
<br/>
I initially gave it a C-, but it does get better as it warms. <br/>

04/07/17: picked up a sixer in NYC to re-review out of the fear my previous bottle may have sat out at room temperature in the store too long.<br/>
<br/>
Glad I did! This is surprisingly well-balanced fare that conceals its ABV very well and offers pleasant notes of floral hops, pine, and more minor fruity flavours, showcasing Centennial quite well. Pale malts keep any hop bitterness at bay.<br/>
<br/>
A highly drinkable IPA I'm pleased to say I was wrong about before (or maybe I had an improperly stored bottle). At $12 per sixer in NYC it's tough to justify over better priced possibly superior offerings from Lagunitas (and I'd sooner shell out a few more bucks for Sculpin), but I could see this being a go-to if I lived in a region where it was more affordable.<br/>
<br/>
Nice work from Bell's.<br/>

10/25/18 month old bottle:<br/>
<br/>
Showcases Centennial terrifically. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, which helps coax out additional depth of flavour from the supercascade hop regimen. <br/>
<br/>
Two Hearted is to Centennial what Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is to Cascade. Up there with Racer 5 and Celebration in terms of really well-brewed yet widely distributed IPAs. One of the relatively few IPAs I still pick up at least once every year.<br/>

<br/>
Few IPAs showcase their hop selection(s) as well as Two Hearted Ale showcases Centennial. So often, single hop IPAs are gimmicky and incomplete, feeling more like one-off experiments that are interesting but not fully realized (I'm looking at you, Mikkeller). Two Hearted is the exception - the single hop IPA that proves the right varietal makes all the difference. <br/>
<br/>
Soft pine, bitter grapefruit, superfloral hop flavours, some resin, some juiciness...this hop profile is terrific.<br/>
<br/>
For my money, it's one of the best IPAs in the world, and its addictive piney taste keeps me coming back regularly.<br/>

As I started to open the bottle I could already smell a big amount of hops that this beer had to offer! I was so excited to get that first taste! It poured a nice layer of head that was a little off white and as I drank it, it laced a little bit. The color was a orange bronze.<br/>
<br/>
The aroma was of floral earthy hops. Taste was a massive amount of hops, just like the smell.<br/>
<br/>
Mouth feel was bitter but left a crisp taste in the mouth. Very dry aftertaste as well.<br/>

Appearance - Very slightly hazy deep golden body with a small head. Nice lacing, though.<br/>

Smell - Not a huge hop aroma, really. A bit of a musty smell behind some citrus hops, followed up by a slightly sweetness.<br/>
<br/>
Taste - The hops are way more prevalent here. Good balance of pine and citrus that ends with a flowery sweetness. The malt backbone is just enough to balance it, without coming off as sweet. A strong bitterness finishes it off, but it isn't too much to be unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel - Easy-drinking, although on the heavy side for a single IPA. This bridges the gap to DIPA, I'd say. A bit more an it would be a DIPA.<br/>

Orange, amber, chill haze heaping voluminous mounds of large, dense bubbly foam leaving spongy lace.<br/>

In taste, I get pine first, then grapefruit. Toasty malt come in to support the hops at a moderate level.<br/>

Finish is pretty dry and bitter. Revisiting this beer many times, I easily realize how much this would have turned me off long ago.

But not I can see how well made and consistent this brew really is.<br/>
<br/>
I have also had this on cask, When on cask, I get notes of amaretto, some sort of delicate flower, and passionfruit. On cask these flavors are most prominent, with almost no bitterness to detect, and an unbelievably smooth texture to the point I wonder if it's a beer, especially IPA, at all.<br/>
<br/>
The vast differences between the cask and the standard versions of this beer or so drastic it's unreal, and I'm not sure which I prefer more, because the cask is also odd in its own way, and the warmth doesn't help.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=Sabtos#review"">Dec 23, 2015</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/russpowell.19986/"">russpowell</a></b> from Arkansas</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.85</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+12.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Mad props to BARLEYWINEO for this one!<br/>

Two Hearted is a regional staple in the Great Lakes, i'm sad to see it leave IL (temporarily I hope). <br/>

Pours a cloudy, swirling orange. Big foamy head, spots of lacing ring the glass. Looks like a fresh and lively ale, which it delivers in it's other aspects as well. <br/>
<br/>
Sharp fruity hops in the aroma, abundant but not overboard. Taste follows the hoppy nose, distinctly grapefruit and pale malt. Slight dryness increases it's drinkability quite a bit. <br/>

This is great for a session...i'm going to miss this on tap around Chicago, especially the Empty Bottle (this was their best beer option). Come back Bell's!<br/>

Notes 11-2007: Sampled an ""aged cask"" of this recently, after a year it is way mellow, and strongly similar to hop tea.

Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a fluffy white head that leaves lots of lacing as it drinks. Aroma is all hops. Spicey, piney, grapefruity hops in all their glory. Taste is more hops with a little malt struggling to get through. Medium mouthfeel and ample carbonation round this brew out well. Pretty good IPA.

Has that orange appearance I like. Good head formation, this looks bad ass, 1"" range. Old enough of a recipe that it came out before the advent of aroma hops per se, but its still a nice grapefruit kick in the nose.<br/>

Taste has that mild bitterness, alcohol warmth. Some citrus. Another beer that is real easy to crush several of in one setting. Has a slight caramel edge to it and related sweetness.

<br/>
Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.<br/>
<br/>
A: The beer is a light gold with a foamy, off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.<br/>
<br/>
S: Heavy aroma of hops &amp; citrus (orange, grapefruit &amp; tangerine mostly), very pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
T: Excellently balanced combination of hops bitterness and sweet citrus malt flavors. The two flavors dont battle each other as they do in some beers; rather they blend together even into the after taste.<br/>
<br/>
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation and a very clean finish.<br/>
<br/>
D: This beer is very tasty, goes down very easily, doesnt fill you much and is one of those beers where each sip makes you crave the next more and more.<br/>
<br/>
To put it simply, this is one of the best beers Ive ever had.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=TheManiacalOne#review"">Aug 23, 2006</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/tone77.332060/"">tone77</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.71</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-13.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75</span><br/><br/>Poured from a brown 12oz. bottle.

<br/>
A: Pours a very lightly hazy golden orange in color with some extremely light visible carbonation. The beer has a finger tall beige head that reduces to a thin layer over the entire surface of the beer with some much thicker patches and a very thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant lacing is observed.<br/>
<br/>
S: There is a definite dominant presence of hops in the smell - I get both citrus/grapefruit as well as some floral hops. The aroma is bright but not overly intense, making it very approachable. There is also some underlying malty sweetness (I'm thinking it is more caramel like than anything else).<br/>
<br/>
T: The flavor is similar to the smell but the balance between the malty sweetness and the hoppiness is even better. There is a definitely caramel malt sweetness upfront. The hops and the bitterness follow that but the bitterness is mild and not a palate destroyer. I can taste both the citrus/grapefruit as well as the floral hops with the grapefruit flavor being just a little stronger.<br/>
<br/>
M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly crisp and very refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
O: Extremely easy to drink and definitely a top American IPA - this beer is just delicious and has a great flavor and aroma. The beer has a very inviting aroma and is quite approachable even to people that are not huge IPA fans (like my wife). This beer is definitely sessionable and one that I really enjoy. I would definitely get this one again (too bad it is not distributed locally to me).<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=dbrauneis#review"">Apr 01, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/billolick.4099/"">Billolick</a></b> from New York</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.15</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-3.5%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>12 oz bottle, pours light orange and very clear.

I bought an uber fresh sixer on my recent trip to Ohio and have worked my way through it over the past few weeks. Since I've been more impressed with each passing bottle, this last one should be otherworldly. Damn, I knew I should have bought more than six.<br/>
<br/>
Ripe apricot-amber with an all-encompassing cloud of fine particulates. The ivory colored cap contains the barest blush of pale orange and is a thing of beauty. Milkshake creamythick and hop resin sticky, it leaves buttery thick sheets of minutely pocked lace on the glass that will, no doubt, have to be removed with gallons of scalding water.<br/>
<br/>
Ah... the intoxicating aroma of fresh Centennial hops! As I drank the other bottles, I debated the gloriousness of Two Hearted's nose. At this moment in time, however, I can't imagine a better smelling IPA. The insanely bright, incandescent, pungent, grapefruit juicy hops cement the notion in my mind that every member of the 4-Cs, whether used alone or in combination, and if used skillfully, are the best beer hops in the world, hands down.<br/>
<br/>
I know what this beer tastes like with some age on it and now I know what it tastes like fresh. It has barely passed the 4-week mark from the time of bottling to my mouth... and it tastes like it. A more than solid backbone of buttery soft, teasingly sweet pale malt greets my every sip and is still very nearly annihilated by a hop explosion that is so fresh and so immediate that it makes me want to weep. <br/>
<br/>
This is one of the best examples of a 'candied white grapefruit sections' IPA that I can think of. Spruce makes a welcome contribution, but nothing else gets in the way of the grapefruit love. If I had to think of one word to describe this beer, that word would be 'beautiful'. I'm not talking about the appearance, although it looks great, but about the entire experience. Two Hearted tastes so perfectly balanced, so deliciously hoppy, so... sublime, that beautiful is the only word that truly fits.<br/>
<br/>
The mouthfeel is a smidgen lighter than I'd like, but that's such obvious nitpicking that I'm embarrassed to type it. It's supremely smooth and silky, making the drinking as natural as breathing. An absolutely perfect amount of carbonation doesn't hurt what is, quite simply, mouth candy.<br/>
<br/>
Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a world-class IPA, period. In fact, I'm considering an e-mail assault on the talented Mr. Bell until he decides to extend his distribution area this far west. If I had this fine ale within easy reach, it would have a permanent place in my beer fridge. With regular consumption, say a sixer every week, I'd probably begin to tire of it in... oh, about 2035.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=BuckeyeNation#review"">Jan 14, 2006</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/tmoney2591.322390/"">TMoney2591</a></b> from Illinois</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.38</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+1.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Served in a pint glass at Paradiso.<br/>

I've had this a number of times, but never on cask. Let's do it to it. It pours a hazy orange amber topped by nearly a finger of thick creamy foam. The nose is dominated by the hops (mostly citrus with some pine thrown in for variety's sake), though a current of sweet caramel jets through like the EAC. The taste is very similar, though the balance is much better. Both camps respect each other for their ferocity and professionalism. Damn, does it make for one tasty battle. The body is a light medium, with no real carbonation involved and a severely smooth and creamy feel. This is insanely good on cask, even better than in bottles.

Pours a merky amber color with a nice 1 finger frothy head that was slow to disappear, this just looks yummy. Smell is knock your socks off!! Citrusy hops all the way, unreal smell, orange and grapefruit in there. Taste is loaded down with citrus, with a fantastic dry hoppy finish. A bit of a grassy, pine taste, but one of the most citrus favored hops I have ever tasted. Went down ohh soo smooth, just right carbonation.

Pours a very nice slightly hazy dark golden yellow color, pretty nice carbonation, with a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger off-white head, which also leaves some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, slight malt note, very nice citrus. The taste is really nice hoppy, slight malt note, really nice citrus/grapefruit.

I had a pint of the regular tap first, and some still rested in the glass when the ""real arrived"", giving me the chance to sample them side by side.<br/>
Appearance is darker, a heavier orange/amber, and the head to slim for a freshly tapped Two-Hearted. I've poured some of those with gorgeous froth that sat on the glass like soft-serve ice cream, proud as pudding. So, I missed that...<br/>
Aroma is nice, but not as pungent as the tap.<br/>
Taste is the difference. Where the tap gives you the hops on the palate in a brisk spike, a frisky tingle, then mellows and moves out, leaving nothing bu clean, smooth drinkability, this cask version keeps the hops at play throughout the duration. The body is the main thing affected, and it's creamy, but not too much, for this is Two-Hearted. (I drink the stuff almost every single day, I should know!) <br/>
Drinkablity is big, too, and the character is really key. This was an excellent pint, a big difference, though, blast me down if you must, if prefer the CO2 version. I like that hop attack...but there's something to be said for both...hope to have it again at some other occasion in my lifetime!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=feloniousmonk#review"">Oct 22, 2004</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/puboflyons.237852/"">puboflyons</a></b> from New Hampshire</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.44</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+3.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>From the 12 fl. oz. bottle dated 03/20/15.

Heady, hazy orange-amber pour.<br/>

Those tropical, tangerine, orange, and fruit esters on the nose are remarkable even for a 3 month old bottle. I wish I had a fresher one. I'd probably be spellbound.<br/>
<br/>
Good medium to full body.<br/>
<br/>
The taste has the same amazing fruit characteristics but it all comes together with an almost sinus-cleaning bitterness that lingers dryly at the end. This one deserves the high ratings it gets.

The taste is floral, piney, citric bitterness upfront. Malty sweetness in the back holds the hops together. As it warms, it becomes more resiny. Slight touch of peppery alcohol in the long finish.<br/>

On tap at Als of Hampden served in a nonic. This brew appears a hazed golden orange color with a thin ring of white around the edges of the glass. Bubbles constantly rise to the surface maintaining a thin lacing atop the brew.<br/>
<br/>
The aroma is citrus hop goodness like orange rind, zest, flowers and grass. It is a very bright and enjoyable aroma displaying a depth of pleasant hop characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
The taste is rindy and bitter with citrus hops that are backed by a bit of a toasty caramel malt sweetness that is a good contrast to the hoppiness. The hops are quite citrusy and grassy with a pleasant warming effect from the alcohol. It finishes sharp and bitey from a combination of the abv and hops.<br/>
<br/>
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is easy drinking and enjoyable. Quite crisp and refreshing this is always a standby brew that is enjoyable on nearly any occasion.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=stakem#review"">Mar 30, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/bbthunderbolt.160720/"">BBThunderbolt</a></b> from Kiribati</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-18.6%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.5</span><br/><br/>Received after a friends visit home.

Poured into straight pint glass. Poured a hazy, cloudy orangeish-yellow with just over an inch of white head that dissipated quickly, leaving a medium amount of lacing.<br/>
<br/>
A very nice piney hop aroma greets the nose, with a hint of citrus mixed in. The flavors are very similar to the aromas, lots of pine and citrus, little malt, just amplified.<br/>
<br/>
The body was typical for the style, not light or full. Drinkability was a little better than average since this is not a tastebud burner of an IPA. As with the other 2 Bells brews I received, if this were locally available to me I would drink it in my regular rotation.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=BBThunderbolt#review"">Aug 30, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/bitterbill.708/"">Bitterbill</a></b> from Wyoming</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.4</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+2.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Poured from 12oz bottle(rom temp) a hazy medium gold with a large head of foam that hangs around for the entire session. <br/>

The initial taste is just like the smell(:^) ...a very nice grapefruit bitter bite but there's enough of a fairly sweet malt character there as well to balance things out. Yum. And, at only 6%abv, I just want to drink another and another....<br/>

My first introduction to Bell's Brewery beers several years back. This is a toss-up for me as far as choosing a favorite, as I find their porter to be an excellent beer, too. Regardless, this is one of the two 'must have' beers I grab while visiting Ohio to take back to Colorado.<br/>

a - Poured an orangish/amber color with 2 fingers of white foam and moderate carbonation. Great retention.<br/>
<br/>
s - Smells of hops and sweet malts. A tiny bit of citrus as well. I was actually surprised by the balance; I was expecting a lot more hops and a lot less sweetness.<br/>
<br/>
t - Again, tastes strongly of hops with a little bit of bitterness, followed by sweet malts. I was again surprised how balanced it was and how much the sweet malts stood out.<br/>
<br/>
m -Medium body with moderate carbonation, it has both a bit of a bitterness to it, followed by smoothness from the malts. Very nice.<br/>
<br/>
d - Very nice and balanced. The hops didn't stand out as much as I thought they would, but the balance and smoothness from the malts was a pleasant surprise.

Appearance: pale orange hue with a light haze and a light effervescence. Head is a thick finger of pillowy white foam. Light, but nice!<br/>
<br/>
Smell: hugely aromatic with a very good floral, lightly earthy hop aroma, and a sweet malt backbone. I like it.<br/>
<br/>
Taste: hop flavor is much earthier than the aroma. Slowly, a more citrusy hop character comes up from underneath; I like the dynamism. All of this is on top of a good malt character, which is sweet and complements the hops quite well. Quite good.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel: medium body with a very good level of carbonation and a good, creamy texture. Wonderful.<br/>

Pouring light orange with a mild haze, there's a dense, reverse-cascading head that forms a dense collar, leaving sheets of lace. Perfect. The nose is too, redolent, bright and yet suffuse with beautiful citrus and floral hops. Truly a centennial showcase, the palate replicates the flavor. Opening with a bright citrus and floral hop character, this is really smooth. A touch sweeter than it is on tap, there's a little cotton candy sweetness. Still, this dry, with mild bitterness and an explosion of hop flavor.

<br/>
The appearance is clear and light orange hued. The head stands in at around an inch thick, displays lasting retention and leaving ample lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is not particularly grand, but is pleasant nonetheless. Scents include malt, floral notes, light pine. The flavor is tasty, and though the beer is primarily hop forward, it definitely has a strong malt backbone. This is a good example of what I would consider a ""balanced"" IPA. Though I prefer beers of this ilk to be lighter on the palate and more hop forward with a pronounced citrus component, there is no denying that Bell's Two Hearted Ale is a tasty brew. Additionally, I think this beer, like many IPAs, is a notch better on draft versus the bottle.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=Huhzubendah#review"">May 05, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/guyfawkes.590591/"">GuyFawkes</a></b> from Illinois</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.34</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+0.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25</span><br/><br/>Bottled 6/26/15; drank 8/1/15 @ the Yarchives. <br/>

<br/>
Smell : Mostly tropical aromas. Freshly diced pineapple, a hint of peach, with a faint sparkle of biscuit malts. A slight sweat funk can also be smelled, but it's pretty faint here. Typical, run of the mill IPA aromas. <br/>
<br/>
Taste : A nice strong fruity bite sets in, with lots of bitter rinds and pith. Mostly grapefruit, a bit of apricot, orange. Very faint pine, but subdued enough to be detected and not stealing the show. Slight dankness. The malts are both bitter biscuit and cracker-like, and the grapefruit pith carries out to the end with a slight dryness. <br/>
<br/>
Feel : Substantially creamy and a total party in the mouth pumped with carbonation. I think this is what most people rave about on this beer, the feel is so smooth and it's so drinkable. <br/>
<br/>
Overall : This beats most IPA's in its price range. It's flavorful enough to be enjoyed as a sipper, but quaffable enough to be a session beer.

The mouthfeel is thin, but it's very smooth and crisp. Drinkability is very good too, I think it's a good sessionable beer. IMO, it's a good IPA, I'd definitely buy this again.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=bluejacket74#review"">Feb 09, 2007</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/slatetank.102045/"">Slatetank</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.18</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-2.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>I picked this up at Al's of Hampden as part of a mix a six. poured chilled into a willybecker and allowed to gradually warm. <br/>
<br/>
A slightly hazed golden peach color with monstrous ecru cap w/ light beige accent. The head measures over an inch high and haze is not too much that you can't see some carbonation in the liquid. The bead is average sized and head looks 'whipped' up. The lace sticks like glue and retention is very good. I really like the mild citrus and herbal aroma w/ mild grassiness. There is some lemony/orange aspects w/ lots of yeast esters and some floral hop notes. The feel is moderately bitter up front w/ mild astringency and mellow acidity for the style which is nice w/ moderate carbonation level and semi spicy, semi-dry overall feel with a subtle sweetness and light chalky vegetal tinge in the finish-could be from bottle conditioning.<br/>
<br/>
The taste has lots of hop flavor w/out pushing the bitterness too far forward. The taste has nice herbal hops and mild citrus and spice. There is a light tropical element and mild toasted malt in the flavor w/ hints of pear and light lime accent into to the finish. This is a great IPA, not a 'hop assault' on the palate, but just pleasant honest to goodness drinkable IPA from Bell's. I consider this a top notch example of the style as far as drinkability goes -a go-to beer for me.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=Slatetank#review"">Jan 20, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jason.3/"">Jason</a></b> from Massachusetts</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.12</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>12 oz brown bottle with no freshness date to be found.

<br/>
Appearance: Overly foamy to being with, nice densely rocky head with a patch lace. Slightly hazy in the golden hue.<br/>
<br/>
Smell: Big aroma of floral and citric hop, lots of hops. Faintly ester with a blanket of fruitiness. <br/>
<br/>
Taste &amp; Mouthfeel: Moderate body, smooth crispness and a touch of creaminess in the back. Light pale malt and yeast give a doughy biscuity flavour throughout. The hop character is strong with a semi-sharp bitterness and a long lingering citric toned flavour. Bitter dry finish.<br/>
<br/>
Notes: A super hoppy brew with a puckering dryness that I would only put up against the sharpest of cheddars.

Poured into a mug.<br/>
<br/>
A - This is the second bottle of Two-Hearted that has bubbled over as soon as I opened it. Not sure why this keeps happening, as they both sat relatively undisturbed for quite a while. Apricot color with bright white head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a creamy big-bubbled lace.<br/>
<br/>
S - Sweet citrus, hops, some malt, a little bit floral with a hint of pine. Good balance of bitter and sweet elements.<br/>
<br/>
T - Heavy hop bitterness at the front, then melts into a mix of sweet fruits like peach and citrus (grapefruit, orange, etc.). There's a slight malt character that I get mid-palate that doesn't linger very long. Very good, but not sublime.<br/>
<br/>
M - Has the thickness that I demand out of my beer. No reason that IPAs shouldn't be viscous or creamy too. Not overly carbonated (perhaps because it all came out when I opened the brew?), and very smooth. <br/>
<br/>
D - Bell's - please bring these back to Illinois! This is much more sessionable than Hopsolution. Second only to Masala Mama in this regard. You can't taste the 7% at all, and it's super refreshing to drink.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=MasterSki#review"">Nov 29, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jmdrpi.276070/"">jmdrpi</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.9</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-9.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5</span><br/><br/>12oz bottle, batch code #9977. according to website, bottled on 9/7/10. so about 1.5 months old, pretty fresh. and I bought from the cooler section. <br/>

<br/>
Appearance – Served a light amber color with a tiny white head. The head faded quite fast to leave only a very small amount of lacing.<br/>
<br/>
Smell – The smell is very light and consists of some sweet caramel, bread, lighter fruit smells and a citrus hop smell.<br/>
<br/>
Taste – The taste begins on the drier side and is of a light roasted malt with a decent presence of a an citrus hop bitterness. In the middle it sweetness slightly with some flavors of caramel and light fruit coming to the tongue. These flavors are rather short lived however and fade toward the end, where a more sharp bitter earthy and citrus nature come to the tongue. <br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the slightly above higher than average side in terms of creaminess with a medium level of carbonation. Good for the hop flavors as well as for the more bitter and sharp hop flavors.<br/>
<br/>
Overall – Not much sweetness here but very nice and dry. A flavorful and tasty drier IPA with a nice sharp hop and malty base.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=Darkmagus82#review"">Sep 10, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/drdemento456.330550/"">DrDemento456</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.65</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+8.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>A - A clear amber brown with a full inch of creamy white head.

<br/>
S - Pretty much a citrus bound IPA I also get some gram cracker like malt keeping the hops in check from being to pine forward.<br/>
<br/>
T - Actually better than expected the bitterness seems to be more balanced giving it a juicy fresh citrus and pineapple like bitterness which finishes with the typical fresh baked sweetness of caramel and gram crackers. It's finish is just bitter enough to make you take another sip.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A: Lemony orange body is filled with a rush of macro bubbles. The head stands tall and proud at 2 fingers high with a dull weathered white color, some porous content and a great standing time. <br/>
<br/>
S: Freshly squeezed lemons and oranges, floral scents and some pale grains. <br/>
<br/>
T: The flavor is flowery citrus, slightly drying speak first, crisp pale malting that should not be forgotten. Most ipas tend to kill the palate with an abundance of speciality malts, thus forgetting what the P in IPA stands for. The malting is perfectly balanced with the hops, the sweetness is limited to a brief appearence upfront, no dry toasted caramel, here the pale malts show thier due respect, being crisp, bready, and let the hops come through in the finish.<br/>
<br/>
M: Crisp, light bodied, sparkling and refreshing with a spicy bite of fresh citrus. Tingles off the tongue with a dry hop notice. <br/>
<br/>
O: Overall had this several years ago before i started an appreciation, vocabulary and taste to define such remarkable greatness. Crisp, beautiful hopping that is not overpowering and begs for more easily breaking the outstanding barrier. Smooth, easily sessionable with a lingering hoppiness that goes on long after the beer is finished.

<br/>
S-Big fruity hops. Clementines. Very smooth smell. Malt is nicely intertwined. Smells like a damn good brew.<br/>

T-Hello! Absolutely delectible hop profile. Not violently bitter but more refined and palatable. Fruity hops take over my tongue. Subtle malt, hop foward. I get an almost bubblegum taste on the back end. Delicious and modestly unique.<br/>
<br/>
M-Exceptional mouthfeel. Well carbonated yet slick. Sticks to your tongue. Hop flavors never go away. <br/>
<br/>
D-The alcohol is completely silenced. A 7% brew that could easily sneak up on you especially because the flavor is savory. I wish I could get this beer all the time.

Similar to the nose, a citrus and sweet, floral taste led the way. It wasn’t as hoppy as I thought, but did end in a lingering bitter finish.<br/>

I had no idea that this was in the BA Top 100 for beers brewed in the United States but after having half of this, it's pretty obvious why. Not only is this one tasty and well-crafted beer, but it was good enough to both ""sneak up on me"", but also to make me wish that I had picked up another bottle or two. I haven't had an IPA in quite a long time since most of them tend to be hop bombs or caught up in an arms race for the taste buds. This is totally different than those, as it may be the mnost subtle and balanced IPA that I've ever had. Yes, you heard me right!<br/>
<br/>
The pour for this was truly amazing - even better than SNPA, which has been my benchmark as long as I can remember. I've never (and I mean, never!) seen a beer whose head lasted as long as this. It filled up my pint glass about 90% of this was poured out and part of it remained in my glass more than 2/3 of my way through this. Needless to say, the accompanying lacing was long-lasting as well, and the beautifully luminescent goldenrod hue only added to this beer's allure. This had an opaque radiance to it and the bubbles were also a sight to behold - once again, as numerous and distinctive as those in SNPA, but even longer-lasting. The taste was the shocker...yes, there's floral hops here but there's an incredible balance with the busuity maltness that is almost too good to be true. This doesn't have a dry-hopped aftertaste to it like so many other IPA's tend to have. This is a bit more on the resin side of things - no citru or metallic notes here. Just a bit of lemon and waxy resin to back things up. Nothing overpowering!<br/>
<br/>
7.00% ABV? Can this be? I'm not even feeling any alcohol as I drink this. It's there, but you'll have to look and sip hard to find it. This is perfect for the state in which it was brewed, since the summers there are a bit less harsh than those in most of the rest of the United States. I'm not sure where the two hearted reference ties in but it if it has anythign to do with the malt and hops, than this beer is more than worthy of it's moniker. Arguably the best IPA I've ever had!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=JerzDevl2000#review"">Jan 10, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/halcyondays.145116/"">Halcyondays</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.14</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-3.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5</span><br/><br/>12 oz. bottle, batch 9688,<br/>

Pours a dark side of golden, but clear, with a couple fingers of white head on an aggressive pour. Head maintained quite well and laced the glass with sheets and islands.<br/>
<br/>
Nose isn't very strong, but I get a balanced spiced bread malt note with a bit of citrus bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
Taste starts off a little sweeter than expected, but also with a little bite to it. An orange citrus bitterness balances it out before a more classic grapefruit citrus takes over in the end. A nice full range from malty to bitter, as the end does get decently bitter for an overall seemingly balanced IPA. There is a bit of spice that runs throughout, as well, that seems more from the ingredients than the carbonation (which is soft on this pour).<br/>
<br/>
Definitely a solid, classic, little less balanced than it seems IPA. Seems a little more east coast than west, though the hop profile seems to be more of the latter.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=cjgiant#review"">Feb 23, 2014</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/corby112.268461/"">corby112</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.85</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+12.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Served cask-conditioned at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, PA.<br/>

Taste - Upfront, the hops are sweet orange with a good chunk of bitter pith. Lying beneath, a solid bready malt backbone. Once warmed, traces of buttery toffee can be found mid-taste and toward the finish. Great balance. Aftertaste is pure fresh orange pith bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel - Light to medium body, with a fair amount of carbonation. Smooth, easy drinking; almost buttery on the swallow. <br/>
<br/>
Overall - Certainly not the hoppiest IPA you'll come across, but it may be one of the more unique offerings out there. Beautiful flavor profile. Excellent balance.

A hazy pale golden with lots of little particles being moved around by a few bubbles floating up to a two finger head that lasted for a couple of minuets and left a few specks of lace<br/>
<br/>
S big floral and tropical fruit with a little caramel, quite a nice blend of fruit with a little pine<br/>
<br/>
T again plenty of tropical fruit and a little more pine then I could smell some caramels and no booze whatsoever, enough malt to balance things out preventing the hops from taking over completely<br/>
<br/>
M not sure where all the carbonation comes from because I couldn't see this much in the glass but it creams it up a bit and this beer has great length and sticks to your gums a bit<br/>
<br/>
D this is a great IPA and I was shocked at how easily it went down, for 7%alc it's very dangerous because I would be drinking this at the rate of water and I doubt that would end well<br/>

A- This beer had a thick creamy white head with a second head of big rocky bubbles. The body was a deep orange with no carbonation noticed. There was a very faint haze but not much.<br/>
<br/>
S- The smell of fresh green hops with a faint wriggly spearmint gum note that was nice. There was some soft slightly sweet toasted malt notes tucked in behind the hops. <br/>
<br/>
T- The pale malt with some toasted malt flavor had a nice depth and good character like floor dried malt. The hops were strong but the aroma , taste and bitter hops were all balanced nicely. The faint note of mint bubblegum was in the background but gave a nice twist to the hops. <br/>
<br/>
M- This beer had a medium mouthfeel with a nice creamy texture.<br/>

Kudos to Westy's for bringin' in a whole pallet of 'em. If you feel strongly that I should classify the serving type as something else, drop me a beermail.<br/>
<br/>
A: The ale has a hazy orange color, like a tea or apple juice. The keg pours with a thick 3 plus finger head that requires two pours to fill my glass. Light hints of dried lace evidence that head.<br/>
<br/>
S: The nose is hoppy delicious, thick with orange peel and citrus notes. Solid but subtle caramel malts support the hop nose.<br/>
<br/>
T: Does life get any better than sittin' and sippin' on an IPA like this? The hop profile in this beer is damn near perfect, an excellent blend of citrusy tangerine and sweet but bitter orange peel. Caramel graininess mid-sip seems to rejuvenate the mouth, resetting it for the blast of hops at the end of the sip. The hop profile, either warm or cold, is a real treat, bitter without scalding the tastebuds. This is, by far, one of my all-time favorites.<br/>
<br/>
M: Sweet pungent hops dominate the ale, creating an incredible hop profile that almost defies words. This is easily one of the best IPAs that you'll ever encounter.<br/>
<br/>
D: With proper focus and devotion, I think that i could finish the mini keg in one day. As it is, it'll probably only last two days (this is a good one for the Ravens MNF game). This is not the only mini keg that I'll be purchasing.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=akorsak#review"">Dec 02, 2007</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/bb1313.349757/"">BB1313</a></b> from Ohio</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.74</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+10.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this one before. In my opinion, this is just about the perfect IPA. I have a couple others I love just as much, but technically this is just about perfect. Pours a beautiful hazy golden, nice bright white head and good lacing. Smells great, lots of citrus and tropical fruits up front. The flavors are immaculate and subtle. The bitterness from the hops is great, but nowhere over the top. The keyword is balance. Mouthfeel is great, perfect carbonation. It's very smooth, feels medium-bodied, maybe pushing full. Drinkability is off the charts! Alcohol is unnoticeable and the flavors are outstanding, making it very drinkable. All around enjoyable beer, even if IPAs aren't your thing.<br/>

I tend to take this beer for granted. I don't drink it nearly as much as I should. What sets this one apart from other IPAs is the flavors and balance.

The aroma is comprised of a fresh, floral hop character with even a hint of mint in the nose, accompanied by a bready malt character. The aroma of hops is nearly intoxicating to this hophead.<br/>
<br/>
The taste is very smooth and the breadiness of the malt peeks out from the strong, floral hop bitterness. Only a hint of citrus/grapefruit due to the hops.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel is comprised of a smooth hop bitterness and very mild sweetness and breadiness of the malt. Dry, but not overwhelming. <br/>
<br/>
A very drinkable example of the style at only 7%. I can think of only one area where it may fall flat and that's the mouthfeel, which feels somewhat too dry and citrusy.

zest zest and subtle pineapple notes touched by light breaded malts and honey that fade into<br/>

Resin, grapefruit, and bready caramel malt sweetness dominate the aroma initially. Hints of onion, fresh cut grass, and cattiness add complexity.<br/>
<br/>
Flavor is, at first, somewhat sweet, with caramel malt serving as a nice backdrop for muted grapefruit and strong resin. The finish is moderately bitter. Notes of pine emerge as it warms, and the citrus character strengthens. <br/>
<br/>
Body is moderately full and slightly creamy, with moderate carbonation, slight astringency, and notable alcohol warmth.<br/>

Pours like hazy amber and honey (and at a temperature that was only slightly below ambient!). Smallish but retentive head, good lacing, blah blah you know what a cask IPA looks like.<br/>
<br/>
Smells capital-S Smooth. Two Hearted is normally well balanced but this is just boffo: giant west coats hops were almost, like, fluffed up by a malt so smooth it was like bready whipped cream.<br/>
<br/>
Tastes even better than it smells, since smoothness is one of those things that ain't conveyed too well through the olfactory sense. Hops are like flowers and grapefruit juice, the malt is like poundcake, together they combine into a well-balanced slurry of perfection.<br/>
<br/>
I've said in the past that casks don't really impress me unless they're of thick stouts, but I think I'm going to have to amend that for exceptionally balanced IPAs.

The big difference is Bell's seems to have more control over its use of hops to blend the overall taste more distinctively.<br/>

Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" bright white head above a slightly (but only slightly) copperish golden brew. Head had reasonable staying power, and laced excellently. Aroma is about spicy hops, and there's probably some malt in there, but that's not the point. Smells like what I would imagine something out of the DFH Randall would. The taste is as well all about the hops, but there is enough pale malts to round the corners and keep the taste buds alive. Also slight citrus notes are present. It impresses me that such a hop monster remains quite smooth and imminently drinkable.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/287/1093/?ba=ppoitras#review"">May 06, 2004</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>]"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, pineapple, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, pineapple, grass, pine, honey, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, honey, light caramel, floral, grass, pine, bread, and floral earthiness. Awesome balance and complexity of hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, sticky, and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! Great hop flavor complexity and moderate malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering; but certainly not near the hype it gets.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=superspak#review"">Jun 19, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/zeff80.63854/"">zeff80</a></b> from Missouri</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.84</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+3.2%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>A - Poured out a somewhat cloudy, orange color with golden highlights.

<br/>
Pouring a highly carbonated and creamy overall appearance, the beer delivers the most supple of haze upon a strong golden, light copper hue. A creamy ecru head builds on the beer and coats the sides of the glass with sheets of lace as the beer falls for a very charming and stately appearance.<br/>
<br/>
Aromas of every citrus fruit that you have ever known rushes to the olfactories with an onslaught that's extremely zesty, ripe, and fresh. Only the most supple of malty caramel notes inform the sweeter notions of fruit but intently stray from the focused citrusy notes of oranges and grapefruit.<br/>
<br/>
Flavors follow suit with a strong emphasis on hoppy oils that remind the tastebuds of ruby red grapefruit pulp, freshly grated oranges, and tangerine succulence. Citrusy overall, but it's the underlying malty sweetness of thin caramel that gives the fruity hop flavors just enough sweetness to not become sour, acidic, or overly sharp. Lightly salty in taste, the beer's water profile gives a rounded element that's sometimes lacking in these dry beers.<br/>
<br/>
But the dryness doesn't only manifest in taste, it also presents a quick evaporative feel just after the early creamy notion of malt whisps away and leaves a bitter, resiny-dry finish of citrus sharpness and lightly herbal/grassy bite in aftertaste.<br/>
<br/>
Pliny is a quentessential IPA that displays all the finnese of hop oils and resins for ultimate clean citrus flavor and resiny bitterness. This only happens because of the understated and clean caramel malt base. Although this would normally expose a lot of hop and alcohol harshness in merely mortal beers, it's surprising that none of those show here. Russian River nails this one!<br/>

A - Arrived a slightly cloudy pale orange color with a 1/2 inch head. The lacing is amazing.<br/>
<br/>
S - Smells of delicious flowers and citrus hops. There is also a nice tart fruit smell.<br/>
<br/>
T - Absolutely delicious citrus hops with little bitterness. There is also a subdued fruit essence taste present.<br/>

<br/>
I definitely will be going after more of this brew. One of the most aesthetically pleasing beers I have ever had. The lacing was absolutely the best I have ever seen. There were rings from top to bottom that showed my progress. Sweet.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=UCLABrewN84#review"">Apr 18, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/biboergosum.168458/"">biboergosum</a></b> from Canada (AB)</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.27</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>510ml (?) bottle, 14 days old - fresher than I would ever really have expected. As I was approaching my 2500th review, I was at a bit of a loss as to which beer would be (potentially) worthy enough to mark this particular signpost of mine. Lo and behold, and damned near out of the blue, comes this early Christmas present, from the good DoktorZee - many, many thanks! Into my Laughing Dog Yankee pint glass this goes, in honour of my first bastion of hoppy indoctrination.<br/>
<br/>
This beer pours a slightly hazy, pale golden amber hue, with three fingers of thick, bulbous, and melted marshmallow eggshell-white head, which leaves some broad streaks of sea-spray lace around the glass as it gently slinks away.<br/>
<br/>
It smells of pungent tropical fruit - pineapple, papaya, and blood orange - a bit more pedestrian lemon and grapefruit pith, with some resinous pine needles and musty florals, all over a lightly bready, softly caramelized pale malt. The taste is bitter aged citrus rind - kind of a Cali fruit salad of orange, lemon, and grapefruit - all fresh and in your face, but, um, nice about it. Some further floral, perfumed hops flesh things out, until the unassuming caramel malt supporting act kicks in, along with a slowly simmering, mostly under the radar booziness.<br/>
<br/>
The bubbles are pretty laid-back, just eking out their paycheck, the body a decently sturdy medium weight, and tacitly smooth - the hops and booze respectably keeping their distance. It finishes off-dry, but just barely, the melange of hops contending more with some uppity alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
An on the level, well-rendered DIPA - you get your hop fix, in spades, and yet the inherent balance remains steadfast. I gotta say, it delivers, and though it isn't perfect, what really is? I can see why the hype exists, and will indeed persist.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=biboergosum#review"">Dec 10, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jlindros.163147/"">jlindros</a></b> from Massachusetts</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.72</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+0.6%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Got this awesome-o surprise as an extra from Solomon420, thanks again Damian! I've been holding this beast in anticipation for a short while, and today was my son's first birthday so I decided to crack it. Imagine a kid getting locked in a candy store but also have the unfortunate disadvantage of diabetes or something, that's what it was like not just destroying this beer immediately.<br/>
<br/>
A: It's got a strangely erotic bright orange color with some light haze and light frothy head that sticks around lightly. Super clear color. Even my eyes are thanking me.<br/>
<br/>
N: Hops just dominate and the pine and citrus just rip my nostrils ashunder. The light malty goodness and slight sweetness also dance around the nose, but the added slight grapefruit at the end add a nice touch. A gentle floral adds lightly to it. Earthy beast-like hops ravage my nose, with lots of fresh hop oils.<br/>
<br/>
T: OK, after months of waiting (since I first setup the trade, not waiting on this beer) its time... guhhh, groggle, slurp, very wet and juicy hop burst, not so much of the crazy pine and dryness as expected, its got a delicate citrus grapefruit and slight malty body, perhaps some tropical juicy hop as well. A nice poignant zip. Theres a touch of spicey hops and earthy tones that seem to build up the more you drink it. But there are some nice piny citrus hops as well. This seems to touch each category of hops except grassy. The alcohol is hidden very well.<br/>
<br/>
M: A light malty body with some light carbonation, a slight sticky and juicy feel.<br/>
<br/>
F: Huge hop smash towards the end, lots of bitterness with citrus and pine but still pretty juicy, slightly dry but doesn't dry out as much as I thought it would for the huge hop kick. The intense bitterness fades quickly leaving you begging for more and ready for the next sip. It's got a big juicy slab in the middle of the end that just makes the drinkibility astronomical. I'm just slamming this thing back like it's going out of business, which is dangerous for 8%.<br/>
<br/>
Final thoughts: This is an incredible beer, as expected. I had huge hopes and it didn't smash them. Perhaps could have used a slight more malt (I'll prolly get reamed for that) but thats IMHO. The hops and flavors are so balanced that it was just amazing to keep drinking and drinking. So many different hop flavors that balance out well and come from every angle, like getting gang jumped. I can't wait to get more. It's almost as if someone juiced a grapefruit using a pine cone made of love and ecstasy. I feel like a hopped hippie after drinking this!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=jlindros#review"">Sep 06, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/sammy.3853/"">Sammy</a></b> from Canada (ON)</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.15</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-11.5%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Light orange body and good white head that lasts.

The nose is bold and bright with juicy, resinous hops (piney, citrusy, grassy) that you can almost smell at arms length! In the mouth it's medium-full bodied with an standard carbonation. <br/>
In the flavor (which is pretty much exactly what the aroma suggested it would be), the sweetish, straight-forward malt acts as a bed for the hop flavors to lay in; but they just can't seem to stay still, and bounce up and down on it instead! <br/>
The alcohol is very well cloaked throughout; and it finishes drying as the sweet malt ebbs away, leaving behind a dull bitterness and some lingering piney and citrusy notes. <br/>

Overall the beer is fantastic.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=WoodBrew#review"">Nov 24, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jugs_mcghee.492136/"">Jugs_McGhee</a></b> from Oklahoma</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">3.72</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-20.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>500ml brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into De Molen stemware in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. <br/>
<br/>
A: Pours a 2.5 finger head of nice cream, good thickness, and good retention - especially for the style and ABV. Colour is a transparent yellow. <br/>
<br/>
Sm: Fresh floral bittering hop notes. Maybe cascade? I'm bollocks at guessing hop varietals, but I do know that it's wonderfully pleasant and inviting. A moderate strength aroma. <br/>
<br/>
T: Lovely fresh hop notes and floral notes. The balance is sadly off, with too much bitterness in the 3rd act and finish. It's a shame because the first two acts are so fresh, pleasant, and wondrous. It's quite well built. Deep, layered, and complex for the style. I'm impressed, but it's not without its shortcomings. <br/>
<br/>
Mf: Smooth, pleasant, and wet. I'd definitely stop short of refreshing, but it's pretty good. Complements the flavours really well. <br/>
<br/>
Dr: Very drinkable and pleasant for the style. Hides its ABV very well. I'd have it again on-draught - which is a rarity for me given the style. It's good and pairs well with meat, but it's not quite exemplary. I've had better IPAs.<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
Having tried many more beers in the style, I decided to revisit this one on 12/21/12. Bottled 11/30/12. 510ml brown glass bottle served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass. Expectations are high. Served straight from the fridge. <br/>
<br/>
A: Pours a beige three finger head of nice froth but little cream, good thickness, and great retention considering the ABV. Body colour is a clear yellow/pale copper. No visible yeast. No bubble show. <br/>
<br/>
Sm: Pine, pleasant citrus and floral hops, lemongrass, and nectary hops. No detectable hop bitterness, yeast, or alcohol. Pleasant and fragrant. Above average in strength. Appealing.<br/>
<br/>
T: Grassy body with complex floral notes across the board balanced well against its subtle pine. A bit nectary. Flirts with a light soapy character but never quite crosses the line. Pale malts lend it body without compromising the well-executed balance. No yeast or alcohol comes through. It's very refreshing and enjoyable, with minimal hop bitterness. Very balanced and tasty, if somewhat simple compared to other beers in the style. <br/>
<br/>
Mf: Smooth and wet. Nectary. Refreshing. Good thickness and palate presence; very light for the style and ABV. Complements the flavours well. <br/>
<br/>
Dr: I know far more now about the style than I did when I last reviewed it a year ago (12/08/11 review above), but I still have to give it the same score. There is more to be done with a double IPA, and this is not the best one out there. I recall liking Heady Topper and Port 15 far more than this. An excellent Double IPA that would pair very well with any food. Hides its ABV well. Well priced for the quality ($3.25-$6.99 in L.A.). <br/>

<br/>
***<br/>
06.20.17 impression on-draught at Freshcraft in Denver. Cost was $8.50 USD per 16oz pour.<br/>
<br/>
Vibrant copper body colour. White head 2cm in height.<br/>
<br/>
Aroma brings floral hops, pine, and vague fruit. Pale malts seem to balance out any hop bitterness. Aromatic intensity is average.<br/>
<br/>
Taste and texture: Creamy, smooth, wet, not unrefreshing, well carbonated.<br/>
<br/>
Floral and vaguely fruity, with some light resin in there as well. A robust pale malt backbone keeps it balanced.<br/>
<br/>
OVERALL: Drinkable for its ABV, but the balance isn't quite dialed in and I've certainly had expressions of the style that boasted more intricacy, diversity, and depth of flavour. Hop profile could be more interesting.<br/>

Also had on tap in cali. Bottle dated 12/23/09<br/>
<br/>
Poured into New Belgium Globe Glass<br/>
<br/>
Pours almost 1 and 1/2 fingers of creamy beige colored head. Good retention. Leaves some splattered lace. Color is a nice hazy bright peach orange. <br/>
<br/>
Aroma: This is smelling great. Everything a DIPA should smell like. Grapefruit citrus, some bananas. A bounty of fruits. Floral and pine hops tingle the nose (interesting).<br/>
<br/>
Taste: Massive floral hops. A ton of citrus. Grapefruit, pine, honey. This beast is nice and hoppy, but not as big as a floral kick as blind big. Bananas and peaches are also present. The malts are very bready. A touch of alcohol is also near the end.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel: Not as bitter as I would expect, but the bite is there. I can imagine it being much more bitter when it is very fresh. Medium bodied. A nice amount of carbonation here. Leaves the typical dry hoppy aftertaste with a touch of booze. <br/>
<br/>
Overall, very drinkable at 8% abv. Great beer at a great price. When I get to Cali I want to find this beer as fresh as possible (well, I got there). I really like this DIPA. I was however really confused that blind pig had a much bigger floral and hop taste. I think this is a great DIPA, but I was just a little confused with this one.<br/>
<br/>
One more edit: after having them side by side I realized that Pliny packs a huge punch. It brings a ton of flavor and has a much larger body compared to blind pig. I am glad I had both of them side by side so I could realize this. It makes blind pig taste so like and almost watery.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=mothman#review"">Jul 09, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/stevoj.638668/"">stevoj</a></b> from Idaho</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.66</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-0.6%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>On tap at the Platypus Pub in Bend, OR.

<br/>
Appearance - Beautiful white head with lacing that clings to the glass. Golden with just a bit of haziness. This is what an IPA should look like.<br/>
<br/>
Smell - There is no way to justify the aroma of a fresh Pliny. Hoppy, citrusy, barely a hint of malt. Strong grapefruit smell. Clearly a hop bomb.<br/>
<br/>
Taste - No surprise: hops. Fresh orange and grapefruit flavors and a bit of pine. Slight sweetness, but it stays behind the hop flavor. Very little bitterness in the start. The bitterness lingers with the finish. The only reason I don't give this a 5 is that it is that the quantity of hops brings it dangerously close to a grassy taste. It's not there yet, but you can tell how close it is.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel - Light for a DIPA, which I think is great. Tingling carbonation adds to the freshness and brightness.<br/>
<br/>
Overall - This beer is why I don't enjoy other IPAs anymore. I know what an IPA can be and I expect it out of every other one I have. This is the bar.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=Alieniloquium#review"">Apr 08, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/sabtos.1081399/"">Sabtos</a></b> from Ohio</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.22</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-10%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Proud Pliny first-timer. The second I broke the airtight seal on the cap, before I even removed it, with my nose at least 3 feet up from the bottle, my eyes widened in awe with the immediate understanding of what everyone has talked about for so long. The fact that the scent could hit my nose that quickly, strongly, and pleasantly was truly impressive.<br/>
<br/>
The nose on this is definitely the best part of the Pliny experience, for me. Very tropical, exotic, transporting to some other heavenly world without being fruit juicy or indicative of any of the upcoming bitterness. I'm not sure I've smelled anything quite like this from a beer that wasn't intentionally infused with an overpowering fruit or other ingredient.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, the taste of this doesn't quite live up to the preview that the aroma gives. While it is a pretty delicious brew compared to most IPAs, the light tropical scent gives way to a typically hoppy-bitter IPA. While still citrusy, it's a flavor profile that a number of breweries have been consistently providing for years. I would throw out Gangster Frog, Jai Alai, or even 60 Minute IPA in a blind taste test and bet it would be very difficult to identify Pliny based solely the flavor.<br/>
<br/>
I received the bottle later than I would have liked--it was around 20 days old, but still quite fresh. However, I'm sure that affected the flavor. Still, this was definitely worth the trouble getting, and I would love to visit Russian River in person someday.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=Sabtos#review"">Dec 14, 2015</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/russpowell.19986/"">russpowell</a></b> from Arkansas</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.55</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Got this one from tpd975, Cheers Greg!<br/>

Updated rating: the last few bottles had a much better nose! Not as good on draft IMO...<br/>
<br/>
Pours an effervescent apricot with slight chill <br/>
haze &amp; 2 fingers of thick egg shell colored head. Great head retention &amp; good lacing<br/>
<br/>
S: Citrus &amp; pine, plus floral &amp; grapefruit hops<br/>
<br/>
T: Grapefruit, pine, breadyness, some dryness &amp; resiny hops up front. Grapefruit &amp; resiny hosp seize the flavor focus as this warms, some breadyness sneaks through as well. Finishes with much grapefruit, resin &amp; a touch of toffee &amp; pineapple<br/>
<br/>
MF: Medium bodied, with medium carbonation &amp; some creamyness to this. Great balance<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Orange body with more yellow-orange tones toward the base of the glass. Micro sediment hangs in suspension. Bits of spotty lace around the edge, with a good skim of foam, nice retention. <br/>
<br/>
Juicy citrus aroma, sweet cotton candy, juicyfruit gum. Some resiny hop oils in the back. Nothing but rich fruity hops in this one!<br/>
<br/>
Initial sips are bitter, some floral hop and grainy malt notes, tropical fruitiness, with a long earthy finish. Maltiness is huge, which performs a balancing act with the large hop load. Alcohol is slightly perceptible. Smooth and creamy feel, light astringency that is not a distraction. A fine savory beverage... <br/>

Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy off white head that disappears quickly. Nose is hops, lovely piny resinous grapefruity hops. Leans more towards the pine than to the citrus side. Taste is pretty much a citrus and pine explosion that leaves the mouth coated with bitter hop oils. I can't find any malt here, but I'm okay with it. Finish is dry, but the taste lingers begging you to take another sip. Well I've wanted to try this forever and finally got a chance, now I want more!!

<br/>
Appearance: Pours out a clear, brilliant, pale gold body with a sudsy, enduring, white head.<br/>
<br/>
Smell: Quite a vibrant nose with many a perfumy aromatic - expressive notes of fresh florals, citrus oils, resinous pine, and even peaches fill the air. <br/>
<br/>
Taste: Starts with a simple introduction of extra pale malts with some cracker tones to it and a relatively light sweetness. Flavors of oily lemon peelings, pine needles swimming in sap, meadow flowers, white grapefruit, and even white peaches usher in a bold bitterness. Picks up some spicy accents on the back end. As one would expect, it finishes dry and bitter with a lingering resinous quality.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Has a slight oily slickness to the mouthfeel.<br/>
<br/>
Drinkability: After well over a thousand reviews, I'm not sure what there is left to be said. PtE is a stalwart of the style.

<br/>
A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a large off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.<br/>
<br/>
S: The aroma is a very good combination of fruity citrus and grassy hops, along with some caramelized malts.<br/>

S: Some light amounts of malt sweetness in the smell but the aroma is dominated by the hops. I found the hop smell to be very inviting with tropical/pineapple + mango, citrus/orange, grapefruit, and just a hint of pine.<br/>
<br/>
T: An overall well balanced flavor with some upfront malt sweetness followed by the flavors of all the hops. There is a great combination of hop flavors - hint of pine, some more citrus/orange, even more grapefruit, and tons of tropical/pineapple +mango. There is a good amount of bitterness from the hops but it is not overly agressive. <br/>
<br/>
M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth.<br/>
<br/>
O: This is one of the most enjoyable beers I have ever had, I tried these when I was out in CA before I starting writing up reviews and had been waiting to get my hands on one now that I started writing reviews. This beer is probably one of the best smelling beers I have found and really stands up to the hype it gets. Very pleasant to drink and definitely one to get if you get the chance. The bottle was very fresh.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=dbrauneis#review"">Apr 15, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/billolick.4099/"">Billolick</a></b> from New York</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.6</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-1.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Tried/enjoyed this over the course of 10 days in the Sierra and San Diego about 5 times.sheesh, I wish this was on tap in just about every craft beer stop in my neck of the woods!

Bottled Jan 11th 2011 and we are good to go. Opened at 10:30 in the morning having rested my palate through the night with nothing to eat or drink for fourteen hours. Thanks to TKEAnimal for the bottle.<br/>
<br/>
Pliny pours a nice gold out of the bottle and leaves a simple large fist sized off cream white head. Nice uniform pinhead bubbles in the head also. The body is an incredibly clear twenty four carat gold color, with next to nothing for carbonation from the bottle. The occasional bubble pops up. The head has basic soapy tight retention and leaves sticky lacing fairly well. It really looks like a beer that came out of the tap.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing off the bouquet is how incredibly balanced this beer is. Nothing is overpowering, but it contains a simple grapefruit sweet but not bitter and oily, and fresh hop character to it. Each gets a change with each other nicely.<br/>
<br/>
Taste is quite enjoyable. Once again this is really balanced with a great body and feel. It's taste resembles it's nose in a balanced mix of hop and grapefruit citrus that isn't bitter or rindy with fresh apple juice qualities. Nice aromatics off the swallow also like a fruit basket quality. Eight percent alcohol level is virtually unnoticeable or detectable.<br/>
<br/>
The beer also looks and tastes like something that comes out of the tap, not the bottle. Drinkability is pretty exceptional I guess I can see why people want this beer so much.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=Smakawhat#review"">Feb 19, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/buckeyenation.3819/"">BuckeyeNation</a></b> from Iowa</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.92</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+4.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Received from RedwoodGeorge as part of his recent Home Bottling Project.

<br/>
Sun-fired ochre with lemon drop edges. The alabaster crown is a thing of beauty. It's firmly creamy (and eventually vanilla milkshake melty) and is a lace generator of the highest order. The upper third of the glass is almost completely coated with thick, frosting-like lace. It'd be great to see some hop flecks swimming about, but for a 'clean' DIPA look, it's hard to beat.<br/>
<br/>
I had little doubt that the nose would be dripping with hop esters and I'm happy to report that it is. In terms of absolute resinous pungency, it might take a backseat to the Younger, but it's still one of my all-time favorites. It's hard to go wrong with Vinnie at the helm and with a hop bill that consists of some of the best hops in the world: Simcoe, Centennial, Columbus, Chinook and Warrior. Just typing the list gives me goose bumps and makes my mouth water.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason (reputation perhaps) I didn't expect to like the Elder as much as I liked the Younger. Not that it's even possible, since I consider the latter to be one of the top handful of DIPAs in all the world; and therefore one of the top handful of beers in all the world. I have to say, though, that it's close. This is an outstanding effort that hits all the right notes in that 'ideal DIPA symphony' that I listen for each time I crack open a bottle and take a drink.<br/>
<br/>
If anything, the malt:hop balance favors hops more in this beer than it does in the Younger. Since the brewery calls that beer a Triple IPA (I believe it!) that utilizes three times as many hops as their standard IPA, it has to be a relative lack of malt. I'm not one to complain about a beer's hoppiness, but keep in mind that the Elder is more raw and more smack-you-silly bitter than the glorious, nectar-like, hop explosive smoothness of the Younger.<br/>
<br/>
In the right hands, a hop bill as incredible as the one listed above can't help but result in a mind blowingly delicious beer. And that is exactly what has made the journey from Santa Rosa to my mouth. Brilliant, palate-shattering, hopsticky white grapefruit, pineapple and lemon zest fill my mouth and ravage my tongue... and I couldn't be happier. Who cares if the Elder doesn't have the well-mannered elegance of the Younger? True hopheads will rejoice in its 'no holds barred' alpha acidity, much as I'm doing now.<br/>
<br/>
I've been so blown away by the flavor that I haven't yet given a thought to the mouthfeel. No matter, I still have a third of a bottle left. I'd better be quick about it because the 8.0% ABV is beginning to catch up with me in a big hurry. The mouthfeel, while less full, syrupy and sticky than the Younger, is still outstanding. Again, I have to thank RedwoodGeorge for an amazing re-bottling effort that is nothing less than perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Pliny the Elder is an equally hoppy, slightly more bitter, lower in alcohol, lighter bodied (but still full-bodied) version of Pliny the Younger. Both are exceptional beers and both deserve every accolade that is bestowed upon them. More hop alchemy from the ridiculously talented Mr. Cilurzo. Long may he brew!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=BuckeyeNation#review"">Apr 24, 2006</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/tmoney2591.322390/"">TMoney2591</a></b> from Illinois</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.47</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.<br/>

My second Pliny, but first review thereof. It pours a hazy, golden amber-straw, topped by a quickly-dying finger of white froth. The nose comprises a hella-ton o' pine, along with some grapefruit, orange peel, maple sap, and a tiny bit o' caramel in the back, trying to maintain some semblence of a malty backbone. It's got me convinced it's hoppy... The taste follows very similarly, though the two DIPA elements are both sharpened for battle: The hops are especially fruity and flowery, while the malts (caramel and toffee, natch) are stronger, more up to the task of balancing out the hops. I gotta say, the hype has been dead on: this is the most balanced DIPA I've had in a long time. And quite tasty, too. The body is a light-ish medium, with a moderately active carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Yup, this old Roman naturalist lives up to the hype. Get some!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=TMoney2591#review"">Jun 30, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/clayrock81.170415/"">clayrock81</a></b> from Florida</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.28</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-8.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Poured a clearish orange gold body with monster two-finger head that died slow and left lace everywhere the whole beer. Huge hop aroma of sticky, wet, earthy hops with that familiar grapefruit and citric/clovey spice hop zip, along with some sweet or plush tropical fruit smell that is a tad noticeable and there is a touch of some caramel and/or bready malt. Beer is medium-bodied, easy to drink, incredibly smooth for the amout of hops in there and it packs a lot. Almost chewey and a dangerous session ale since you can't even pick up any alcohol, this beer is the exception of most DIPAs in that instead of crushing/drying out your tastebuds it wets them and leaves you wanting more. Not only are there the strong grape/citric hops flavors with spice but there is a sweetness to this beer that gives it nice balance and a strong, bready crackerlike malt backbone that holds everything up and what a delicious finish. For everything I heard about this beer it was definitely worth the wait.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=clayrock81#review"">Apr 05, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/mikesgroove.104485/"">mikesgroove</a></b> from South Carolina</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.42</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-5.8%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Enormous thansk goes out to zrrbrrt for the growler!!<br/>

Less Than 2 months on this one. Pretty Nice!<br/>
<br/>
Poured into a Squatters true pint glass a very very slightly cloudy dark golden orange color, very nice carbonation, with a HUGE two-finger plus thick/creamy white head, which leaves some small islands and some very nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is very nice hoppy, with some very nice citrus, and pine note. The taste is very very nice, hoppy, maybe a slight malt note, very nice citrus, and some nice pineyness. Medium body, with a nice little chewyness, and a very nice dry/bitter finish. ABV is hidden very well. Overall, a treasure to drink, glad to see some bottles lying around at the store. Highly Recommended!<br/>

I chose to review it (finally) after my girlfriend brought me a 2 liter growler full of it when she had stopped at the brewery on her way back to So. Cal.<br/>
<br/>
The color of this beer is a nice golden/slightly orange straw color with a good head on top.<br/>
<br/>
The smell of this beer is amazing. I would say it is by far the most aromatically pleasing beer I've come across. Usually a (D)IPA has a pleasing smell, but this is on a whole different level. It's really difficult to describe, but lots of citrus and some mild pine, very floral. The smell of this is better than the taste of many other beers I've had.<br/>
<br/>
The taste is as you would hope/expect it to be. Lots of hoppy citrusy and bitter goodness. Hardly any malt on this one, but just enough to balance things out on the end. Many times with a really hoppy beer you get a powerful/off-putting aftertaste, but nothing of the sort here.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely the best beer I've had to this point.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=brokensail#review"">Jun 22, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/stevedore.703648/"">Stevedore</a></b> from Oregon</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.62</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-1.5%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>510ml bottle (bottling date 1/29/2013) poured into Bells tulip glass and consumed today, 2/19/2013- making for a 3 week old Pliny.<br/>
Updated: I'm editing this review to reflect the multiple times I've had Pliny on tap at Monk's Cafe since the very first time I had it (which was out of the bottle).<br/>
<br/>
Aroma: Primarily citrus grapefruit with floral hops, followed by a nice, sweet bready maltiness that evokes caramel and toffee. Honestly, as soon as I pop the bottle, it explodes with grapefruit aromas. A true delight to sniff all the way to the end of the bottle. <br/>
<br/>
Colour: A beautiful crystal clear copper/burnt orange body. Pours with a big fluffy 3cm white head that dissipates within minutes. Lacing and collar is nice, bubbly yet viscous-like. Really has a great looking pale ale-type body. <br/>
<br/>
Flavour: Floral +grapefruit hop blast at the beginning quickly balanced out by sweet caramel and toffee. Before the sweet maltiness comes into play, I quickly get a transition into a citrus bitterness, reminiscent of grapefruit and even some hints of orange and mango. Really well-put together DIPA with a malt backbone that gives this DIPA the complexity that makes it so well-received. <br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel: Medium body on the thicker end of the spectrum, wonderfully well-carbonated leaving the tongue buzzing with pleasure. Aftertaste is of the combination citrus and floral hop bitterness that coats the tongue nicely and doesn't let go. Just about what I expect from a DIPA like this. However what really sets this apart is how drinkable it is- despite its 8% ABV, I don't taste any booziness or heat at all, and it's scary how quickly this 510ml bottle disappeared. I'm not 100% sure what it is about this beer but I just want to keep drinking it. Also, when I'm in Philly, it's crazy how quickly 3 pints of Pliny and $22.50 disappears in a night out at Monk's. <br/>
<br/>
Overall: A fresh DIPA that deserves the vast majority of the hype it gets on this site. Great drinkability, awesome complexity with its balance of bready malt sweetness and bitter hop characteristics , which is slightly skewed towards the hops. It's also a great looking beer for its class. An incredible beer that is a standard bearer for the west-coast DIPA. I have had this and Heady Topper and I can confidently say I would rather have Pliny over Heady if I could only choose one to drink for the rest of my life.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=Stevedore#review"">Feb 19, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/thorpe429.243272/"">Thorpe429</a></b> from Illinois</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.2</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-10.4%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Thanks to Jerk44 for this one.<br/>

The smell is ... well - hops abound! Citrus, pine/resin, some herbal (going towards medicinal) over a biscuity malt.<br/>
<br/>
The taste is very hoppy - citrus/grapefruit and pine/resin and leafy with a rounded caramel/toffee sweetness. The alcohol is deceptively well-hidden for 8%. Bitter but with with a rounding sweetness in the finish - a very ""big"" IPA - putting it into Double IPA (""Triple IPA""?) category - not as sweet and boozy as other examples of the style - truly a bigger IPA.<br/>
<br/>
It is medium-to-full bodied - chewy, yet creamy.<br/>
<br/>
Bitter, but rounded - this is deceptively drinkable!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=jwc215#review"">Oct 04, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/rudzud.453801/"">rudzud</a></b> from Massachusetts</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.28</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-8.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Big thanks to JLindros for sharing this brew.<br/>

A - Poured into a snifter a clear golden hue with a creamy head that left very nice lacing and good retention.<br/>
<br/>
S - Solid bitter west coast pine and grapefruit citrus notes intermixed with nice malt sweetness.<br/>
<br/>
T - More of the nose. Good bitter hops, predominantly citrus/pine resin, with a good hearty malt backbone.<br/>
<br/>
M - Really nice, ABV isnt that noticeable. Smooth carbonation Very drinkable and very oily with the pine resin.<br/>
<br/>
O - Overall this is a delicious IPA. I wish I could get this legit fresh, like, tapped at the brewery fresh. Alas, that just isnt meant to be.

I give the nod to on tap being my favorite experience until this point. Huge thanks to Smoked for bringing a growler of this to my place after visiting Russian River.<br/>
<br/>
Poured into a snifter, this brew appears a golden orange color with some fine particulate floating around in suspension. A creamy off-white finger if head appears and holds fairly well across the top. As it slowly recedes, it leaves a webbing pattern of lacing effect on the glass.<br/>
<br/>
The smell of this brew is exceptionally bright with fresh juicy hop quality. Quite dank and almost cheesy with a bounty of the expected notes of citrus oils and pine resins. More sniffs reveal fruity and floral aspects overtop of a toasty grain base.<br/>
<br/>
The taste is quite toasty with grain that provides a pleasant toasted character without any backing of sweetness. Almost excessively bitter and by that I mean it pierces the tongue with an oily quality that lasts long after each sip. Rind-like bitterness of orange meets grapefruit with an accenting fruity kick of alcohol. The brew gets a little floral as it warms along with grassy notes, sulfur, cheese and dank to herbal weed quality.<br/>
<br/>
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Easy drinking and very oily with hops. So bitter yet so enjoyable. Very drying on the tongue thy promotes an easy transition into the next sip. This is without a doubt the brightest and more fresh sampling of Elder I have ever had. Pretty much the only way to top this experience would be to go to the source the day a new batch is released.

After years of hype and expectation, could this beer live up to it's reputation?<br/>
<br/>
A decent looking medium/light straw color that poured with a lot of carbonation leaving more head than I prefer. The beer was very clear and the head left a solid amount lacing.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the aroma was predominately grapefruit hops but the pine scent lingered in the nostrils.<br/>
<br/>
This beer was all hop flavor with little to no malt foundation on the tongue. The citrus tastes gave seamlessly way the sticky pine flavors, making for a nice flavor progression.<br/>
<br/>
The body was very thin and gave a less than great experience in the mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Drinkability was good but the beer drank too smooth and easy for an IPA. The beer drank as easy as water. Not saying that the beer was watery, but without the hop sharpness and malt backbone that make IPAs enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
Overall a good, solid IPA that I enjoyed, but found not worthy of it's place among the immortals in the heavens. A couple other thoughts. I had several of these over the course of a week so this review reflects the combined experience, not a single glass. I thought that 8% was a little on the low side for an Imperial IPA, Hop rod Rye is also 8% and considered a standard IPA, and in my opinion a much better beer. The beer may have suffered in my eyes due it's reputation, but I did not think this was the 7th best beer in the world as the rankings here show.<br/>
<br/>
Edit 8/4/20. 16oz bottle ( courtesy 2beerdogs/Roguer. dated 6/29/20) poured into 14oz teku. Most of my above review holds true. I've had it several times now, and happily drink it each time. It's still a really good brew, and should rightly be considered an American classic. Drink it whenever you get the chance.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=BBThunderbolt#review"">Jun 15, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/bitterbill.708/"">Bitterbill</a></b> from Wyoming</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.2</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-10.4%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>I was only able to snag one bottle for myself; I'm sure it'll be easier to find in CO in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Let me preface this by saying that I've had samples of this brew at a few GABFs and along side Pliny The Younger, I thought this one played second fiddle.<br/>
<br/>
A nice medium gold in colour with a good 2 finger bilowy head of foam. Good head retention as well as good lacing. <br/>
<br/>
The smell is massively hoppy. Lots of grapefruit and mango with other bitter fruit notes along with pine and..well..I don't perceive any malt presence at all but I *expected* that.<br/>
<br/>
The taste has all of the hop characters I mentioned in the smell with just the slightest ""hint"" of some malt. Maybe that will change as I get further into the session.<br/>
<br/>
The mouthfeel is nice at medium though at times, it feels more like light, and there's some oily slickness on the tongue. The carbonation is on the high end of light but that's working very nicely here. For an 8%abv brew, I think RR did well to hide it..probably because the flavours are too powerful for me to notice it. ;^)<br/>
<br/>
Man, this is one bitter brew! I'm halfway done with my glass and the malt can still only be called as having a ""meek"" role. Still, this one is and was all about the hops and in that, they've succeeded to the nth degree and I was just in the mood for a good, bitter DIPA but I don't think I could drink this on a regular basis as it's just palate ""destroying"". I think I prefer Blind Pig but that's just me...<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=Bitterbill#review"">Aug 26, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/knapp85.408506/"">Knapp85</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.65</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-0.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Oh the mighty Pliny... Waited quite a while to finally try to gem. I was tipped off by a gentleman that moved to Pa from Cali about where to get Pliny in our area. He spoke if the Spinnerstown Hotel as if it was a sacred holy land of beer... He wasn't too far off! Long story short about a year after he mentioned it to me I saw the S. Town Hotel got it in on tap! I wanted to leave work early that day and fly down there asap! I walk in the door and the same dude from a year ago is tossing back Pliny's like he just bought the keg. I walked up to the bar and got my 1st one. The guy didn't remember me from before and got upset that I was ordering ""his"" beer! I told him that it's his fault because he tipped me off about it... Anyway it's got a lovely golden yellow color with a nice head in it. The aromas are breath taking. The flavors of pine like hops sting your mouth and make you beg for more. This beer is so tasty!

Deep, golden yellow body with excellent rising carbonation and a thick, billowy white head; sticky rings down the glass. Cantaloup and ripe, red berry aroma with a citrus scent undertone. Gentle, warm toasted malt; biscuit and a touch of caramel all wrapped together with a bold yet soothing hop bitterness flavor. Medium-heavy body; smooth; clean and dry finish.<br/>
<br/>
After hearing so much about this DIPA, I am glad to see my experience generally agrees with all the hype. Juicy body with a sweet melon tone melds together nicely with an all-encompassing hop bitterness that nicely complements the malt components. One of the best DIPAs out there and in the league with Moylen's Hopsickle, Oskar Blues G'Knight Imperial Red, Victory's Dirtwolf, and To Øl's Overall IIPA.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=beergoot#review"">Feb 01, 2014</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/mdfb79.414386/"">mdfb79</a></b> from New York</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.72</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+0.6%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>a - Poured a light amber color, had moderate carbonation, and about 1 finger of white head that lasted for a long time.

<br/>
Appearance: light tawny golden color with a rocky, persistent head.<br/>
<br/>
Smell: I could smell this the instant I opened the bottle. I could probably smell it across the house. Great gobs of fresh hops, mostly what I would call spicy but some softer, more floral notes as well.<br/>
<br/>
Taste: quite smooth; I guess I was expecting to be blown away with bitter hops, but this beer is more sophisticated than that. The hop flavor is spicy, sweet, smooth and fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel: medium-thick, this guy roams around your mouth, coating your tongue with its impeccable flavor.<br/>
<br/>
Drinkability: despite the high alcohol content and the intense hop flavor and aroma, this is a highly drinkable beer. It could easily get me into trouble.<br/>

<br/>
A: Hazy orange with a dense, two-finger beige head. Excellent retention and intricate lacework on the sides of my glass. Tons of carbonation. Very pretty<br/>
<br/>
S: I've had this before, from a bottle, on tap and from a growler and every single time, I'm a happy man. Tons of hops - floral, citrus and pine. The pine is a lot more assertive than i remember it being but the delicate citrus aroma with oranges and sweet tangerines and floral notes are present and gorgeous. Excellent<br/>
<br/>
T: Starts off with a sharp pine hops with citrus hops coming through adding the distinctive touch of grapefruit and orange zest. Malt is non-existent and this is a hop tour de force all the way. Excellent hop bouquet. Finishes dry, resiny and hoppy<br/>
<br/>
M: Wonderful resiny hops coat the palate while the carbonation works perfectly, bursting little hop globules on my tongue and the drying finish? perfect<br/>
<br/>
D: So much for savoring this. This one's disappearing all too soon :-(<br/>
<br/>
Notes: I think god's playing a big practical joke. I love my dry as hell, brilliantly balanced DIPAs, most of which are outta CA and he puts me on the East Coast.

So it's as fresh as I can possibly get it, since we don't get it in my area. <br/>
<br/>
The pour is magnificent with mango-apricot glows highlighted by pale edges as its light struck. Slight haze, 10% opacity. Head is huge, 3 fingers, and develops a reverse bowl in the middle. <br/>
<br/>
Aroma is...holy smokes. Perfect combination of pine and fruits. Uhhhh...mazing? It's got herbal notes, spicy notes, as well as the trademark freshly peeled orange, cored pineapple, and pine needles. Touches of raw avocado, sushi style. As the head recedes, onion and dank resins come out that slightly distort the pure aromas here. <br/>
<br/>
Taste? Wow. Pliny is neither overwhelming nor plain. I was expecting a palate buster but that's not the case. It scrubs the tongue slightly with a bit of oils and resins, but for the most part it stays very tropical with a hefty dose of malty biscuit notes. Mango, papaya, melon, cantaloupe, orange, pineapple...then the resins come in to dirty it up just a touch. Finish is dirty pine, dried mango, and hop resins. <br/>
<br/>
Feel is thick, juicy, and enough carbonation to let it slide down easily and make it pleasurable. <br/>
<br/>
Pliny is one HELL of a beer. It's no wonder it scores a 100 out of 100 on BA. It's a fine choice and makes it easy for me to finish the whole thing.

500ml brown bottle with a bottled on freshness date.<br/>
<br/>
Mildly hazed orange golden color, solid two fingers of head leave a nice crowning of sticky lace that leaves thick rings on the glass. Big hop aroma of evergreen, clementine rind, pineapple and fresh cut grass. Super smooth with a modest amount of carbonation. Prickly spicy hop bitterness with citric, mint and wild flower flavors that linger far into the aftertaste. Hint of nutty yeast and a big handful of biscuity malt are thrown at the palate and actually shows that this beer has balance. Full bursting orange grove flavor. The 8.0% stays hidden for the most part yet does yield a slow warmth about half way through the pint, a bit of ripe tropical fruitiness within from the esters. Finishes with that long drawn out hop bitterness and flavor as it leans towards the dry side.<br/>
<br/>
Epic, a deserving epic as well even with all of the hype surrounding PTY. Pliny The Elder is the poster-boy for Double IPAs. Every hophead needs to put this on their must try list.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=Jason#review"">Feb 23, 2010</a></span></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/pat61.545285/"">pat61</a></b> from Minnesota</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+6.6%</span><br/><br/>Opens with malt and herbal, citrusy fruity hops on the nose.

Had on tap and also in the bottle, I much prefer the tap version, for this review, it's a bottle version.<br/>
<br/>
Poured a hazy bright orange in my glass with no head and ever so slight lacing around the glass. I was surprised, I thought a double IPA of this magnitude would have been a little darker, it's quite light colored. The smell of this brew is what I really love, it wreaks of grapefruit, pine, slight apricot (but very, very faint). The aroma of this beer is among the hoppiest I've ever smelled, typical of the west coast IPA style and exactly the style of IPA's that I've grown to love so much. At the first sip there's a very quick undertone of malt followed by the same piney citrus notes picked up by your nose. The malt is just faint enough underneath as the hops roll over the top of your tongue to show the malts who's boss here! The mouthfeel is medium to light medium body and just a hint of carbonated bubbles hit the tongue as it goes down. I would prefer more texture on my tongue as it's a little on the thin side. This beer is incredibly drinkable and one that I would love to keep in my fridge year around. Unfortunately, being on the east coast, this one is a little tougher to find. <br/>
<br/>
I did purchase a case of this last week in California and brought it home, I was very surprised at how reasonably priced it was considering the status of this beer. Granted, it wasn't cheap, but for what I paid for it, it definitely was reasonable. Pliny is exceptional, but with the number of talented brewers out there, it definitely stands out in the crowd but not heads and shoulders above the rest. It's perhaps a little bit hyped but I have to say I really enjoyed it. If you're not a hop head, run away, this beer isn't for you. I absolutely love this one.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=jzeilinger#review"">Oct 30, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/masterski.113604/"">MasterSki</a></b> from Canada (ON)</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.65</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-0.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Thanks to nanoslug for sending me numerous bottles of Pliny of the past six months. This one was bottled February 24th, '09. Served in my Kuhnhenn tulip.<br/>
<br/>
A - Huge three-finger pillowy off-white head that has solid retention and patches of spotty lacing. Hazy golden apricot color with lots of tiny bubbles racing to the top. Not quite as handsome as Pliny the Younger.<br/>
<br/>
S - Huge hoppy goodness, with loads of citrus (fresh red grapefruit, orange, lemon zest) as well as some pine and floral notes. There's also a delightful caramel malt backbone. Extremely well hidden 8% ABV.<br/>
<br/>
T - Usually my big complaint is that beers don't taste as good as they smell. In this case, the taste is every bit as good, with loads of citrus and some tropical fruits as well, mixed with pine, and a few floral hints. Again it's got some nice caramel sweetness at the fringes, but the hops are front and center. The aftertaste is bitter, but not overly so.<br/>
<br/>
M - Smooth, creamy, medium-bodied, with the perfect (moderate) amount of carbonation. Finishes slightly dry, but leaves tons of oily, sticky, hop resins behind. There's a touch of warmth as it goes down. Just wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
D - Even more drinkable than Pliny the Younger, which is quite an accomplishment. Perfect level of carbonation, superb taste and texture, well-hidden ABV, and moderate residual bitterness. It's exactly what I want from a DIPA.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I love the 500ml serving size too. I can't wait to try this on-tap at the brewery in the future...<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=MasterSki#review"">Apr 06, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/jmdrpi.276070/"">jmdrpi</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.48</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.5%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>had on-tap at a Russian River event at a local bar.

Bright golden in color, with 1/2"" white head that dissapates after a few sips. aroma is of piney hops, not much else. taste is hop forward, but very balanced. moderate carbonation, very smooth mouthfeel. went down very easy for an 8%abv beer, with no hint of the increased alcohol.<br/>

Do I think it's the #2 beer in the world? no, there are plenty of beers I'd rather have in my favorite styles. But I give this high marks when rating to style, as it is the best DIPA I've had.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=jmdrpi#review"">Sep 10, 2010</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/garthdanielson.522584/"">GarthDanielson</a></b> from Virginia</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.6</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-1.9%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Poured on-tap at the San Diego Brewing Co brewpub. They had it on guest tap while we were visiting. The beer was poured into a pint glass, and it poured a cloudy, golden-copper color with a thin, foamy head. The beer has smells of hops and pine, with lemon-lime notes. The flavor ursts in mouth, with citrusy-sweet notes surrounded by the bitter-greens from the hops. Perfectly balanced and smooth in mouth, with a crisp finish. There is a light, sour balance to the bitter aftertaste, and no linger despite the strong flavors and characteristics. Wow! I think I just made a mess in my pants! I'm glad I got to try this on-tap for my first PtE. Now I am just looking forward to the next time I can find it!<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=GarthDanielson#review"">Jan 09, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/darkmagus82.484016/"">Darkmagus82</a></b> from Texas</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.49</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Poured from bottle into a pint glass<br/>
<br/>
Appearance – Pours a clear golden color with a two finger nearly pure white head. The head has a fair level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a very nice level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.<br/>
<br/>
Smell – The aroma is heavy of a citrus aroma being both sweet and hoppy at the same time. The sweet citrus is of tangerine and orange while the hoppy is of grapefruit. Mixed with these smells is a bready aroma as well as a bit of caramel and some pine hop smells. Overall the aroma is citrusy, but yet still maintains a nice balance.<br/>
<br/>
Taste – The taste begins with a smooth bready and sweeter taste with the sweetness being of a caramel, tropical and citrus fruit flavors of orange and tangerine. With these flavors so too comes some grapefruit hop upfront, which starts out at a moderate strength and grows stronger to the end. Along with the grapefruit increasing some pine hop flavors also come to the tongue while the caramel flavors, that were initially present begin fading. In the end with the hop increasing and the sweet decreasing a nice crisp and mainly citrusy hop flavor to be left to linger on the tongue.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a nice smoothness throughout. The carbonation is on the slightly lower side which when combined with the creamier body of the brew and the nice balanced sweet and hoppy taste overall create a very easy drinking feel. <br/>
<br/>
Overall – A very tasty IPA no doubt, but not as amazing and overshadowing of other IPA of its strength and class as many make it seem, which is likely driven by limited availability/distribution. It is certainly well worth a try though if you get a chance.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=Darkmagus82#review"">Jun 27, 2013</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/rblwthacoz.93332/"">RblWthACoz</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.48</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.5%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Bottle on 7-10-08.<br/>

Pours a basically clear gold amber with a half inch creme head in my snifter. Strong soapy, floral nose. Minor perfume tones. Flavor is just smooth. And I mean unbelievably smooth. I don't think I have ever had a DIPA so smooth to date. Hoppy, yes. But the character isn't trying to scream at me. Soapy hops. Floral tones and minor citrus is there too. Feel is smooth with a good combo of liquid and carbonation. This is truly an amazing DIPA. Its beauty lies in its drinkability. It's so smooth and really an amazing mature recipe. It doesn't have to scream in your mouth to make a point. Rami at Healthy Spirits says he likes it on-tap just a little bit more than the bottle. Oh really??

Gold in color with a white head and thick lacing. Looks nice, but before I dig in, I'm struck by the lack of aroma. I don't get it, there turns out to be plenty of flavor, but there's only mild citrus fruit punch and floral aroma. It's nice, yes, but it should be a lot bigger for a DIPA.<br/>
<br/>
The flavor was great, it coated your tongue with sweet grapefruit, lemon, and tangerine while a bitter citrus rind aftertaste slowly built up. This was very full-flavored, yet oh-so drinkable - a dangerous combination. It never felt that bitter, but by the time my glass was empty, I was feeling it.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=tempest#review"">Apr 19, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/zorro.4151/"">Zorro</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.89</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+4.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Sampled thanks to RedwoodGeorge and his most Excellent trade!<br/>

Pours a mildly hazed orange gold beer with not much head formation.<br/>
<br/>
Smell is loads of pleasant fresh hops. Lots of pine and grapefruit scents. Additional scents of lemon, eucalyptus, mint, black pepper, and cardamom. A super pleasant smell in the same class as Three Floyds Dreadnaught.<br/>
<br/>
Taste is wow perfect! Light malt sweetness with abundant hop flavors. Flavors of lemon, wood, pine, pineapple, black pepper, cilantro, oranges and probably 20 more things that I can't name. Basically this is the IPA that they serve in heaven!<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel is very good.<br/>
<br/>
This is heavenly to drink! There is only one other beer in the same class as this; the much loved Three Floyds Dreadnaught. If you have the opportunity to try this by all means quit your job if you have too and DO IT!<br/>

The bottle said something about drinking this fresh, I forget what, so I thought I better get on it. Split the first bottle with the wife, who'd already had fresh Pliny on tap in California. <br/>
<br/>
I popped the cap &amp; holy crap. The smell. I thought I'd reached IPA scent nirvana the first time I dipped my schnaz into a Furious, but this is...better? Close? The next Pliny is going to be opened right next to a Furious. I have to know. Damn. The taste didn't disappoint. The hops came screaming out of the bottle glass &amp; took my tonuge by storm, like chewing on a liquid, delicious pine cone. Despite that, Pliny managed to keep a relative lightness about it that other IIPAs (ahem, Dreadnaught) lose in the move to higher ABV. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know how many of these I could drink, but I'd like to find out. <br/>

Very floral hop aroma with dank earthy bus notes, resinous hop oils, sticky pine, citrus peel slight alcohol. Lemon peel and grapefruit are prominent with a good bit of earthy pine. Subtle malt backbone but this is mostly all glorious stinky hops. Probably the best smelling beer I've experienced.<br/>
<br/>
Dry bitter floral hop blast up front with a lot of chewy resinous oily hop notes. There are so many different flavors going on here and this is the most well balanced, drinkable beers I've ever had. Lots of sweet citrus notes, mostly lemon peel and grapefruit ans a nice creamy body with subtle malt that provides a perfect balance. Dry sticky pine notes come through in the finish but it is stiil very floral and extremely smooth and quaffable. There is a very slight alcohol warmth towards the end of the swallow and in the finish but otherwise the ABV is very well masked.

Did someone set the hop volume to 11? Huge burst of rich, bubbly hop resin craziness on the nose. Luscious with fruit, pine, citrus even verging on mint or basil. A big, boisterous, powerful, delicious nose. The best hoppy beer I've ever had the pleasure to inhale.<br/>
<br/>
Smooth and clean in the mouth. Not a crazy bitter character, but pungent and fragrant. Starts very clean, with a smooth resin-oil hop character, building towards the back. Finishes dry, but with a lingering sweetness as well.<br/>

Had on-tap @ Capitol Beer and Taproom<br/>
<br/>
Appearance - Served up in a 16oz pint with a white, thin and broken layer of suds. The brew is crystal clear and beautiful golden yellow in color. Good showing from the lacing as the brew is consumed, leaving behind a series of broken webs and some spotting.<br/>
<br/>
Smell - The aroma hits on notes of citrus and pine with a but of stonefruit pit and a light cattiness.<br/>
<br/>
Taste - Follows the nose. Pithy citrus character of orange and grapefruit, with lesser pine sitting beneath. Malts are buried, but hit on some faint, generic bready sweetness. Dry, stonefruit pit nuttiness in the finish, with lingering pith bitterness.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel - Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Decent smoothness with a crisp, dry finish.<br/>
<br/>
Overall - High-time I re-reviewed this legendary brew. While its still great, it's hardly the most interesting DIPA on the market anymore. Many brewers have taken DIPA's to another level, both in flavor and in smoothness. Pliny will always have a place in the beer world, but it's days on the throne are long over.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=TheSixthRing#review"">Mar 03, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/lordofthewiens.40193/"">lordofthewiens</a></b> from New Mexico</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.63</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-1.3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>On tap at Liberty Alehouse in Santa Monica.<br/>

<br/>
S-Multiple levels to the aroma....right away there are some big spruce tree notes...followed by a sweet juicy citrus fruitiness...pinneaples, grapefruit, mandarin oranges tangerines, even some peaches....definitely some Simcoe hops involved...then finishes with some raw cannibus/tobacco notes...quite impressive.<br/>
<br/>
T-I like IPA's that showcase hops flavors more than their pure bitterness...obviously there will always be bitterness but IPA's that bring out flavors as well are the ones I appreciate the most...and this one is exactly what I like about IPA's...it is juicy and flavorful...the malt keeps it from being one dimensional...don't get me wrong...this has a nice strong drying bitterness on the finish but this showcases a complex hop blend nicely with it's juicy flavors....again the fruits are big players...More grapefruit and pine on the taste than the sweeter fruits...also some tobacco notes.<br/>
<br/>
M-Perfect...doesn't feel huge....doesn't feel thin....carbonation is spot on...good strong dry bitterness on the finish...I'm sure the IBU's are up there...but unlike some I have tried this is highly drinkable.<br/>
<br/>
D-Top notch DIPA that lives up to its rep...there are so many good IPA's and DIPA's out there it is tougher than ever for me to come up with a top tier but this would definitely be in it...I like it better than Furious(which really borders on DIPA land) as it is more flavorful, more balanced, more complex and almost as bitter...<br/>

If more DIPA's were like this I would drink them more often. There is a huge hop flavor, but it is not just bitterness. For an admit malt head this is very enjoyable.

<br/>
S - Strong, strong whiff of grapefruit, balanced with some sugar. Peel, light toast.<br/>
<br/>
T - Strong citrus, slightly sweet, very mild peel. Lightly breaded malts with hints of caramel, but impressively smooth. Slightest hint of alcohol, and instead of an aftertaste, the citrus slowly fades. Definitely some impressive bitterness, mild astringency, but not unpleasantly so. Some slight...passion fruit? Tropical sweetness? Not exactly sure.<br/>
<br/>
M - Lovely, creamy mouthfeel. Medium body, no sting, no foaming. A beer that invites you to savor it. Back of the tongue bitterness takes on a slight citrus peel flavor, but it's extremely minor.<br/>
<br/>
O - I'm always worried when the hype runs wild about a beer, but the hype is well-deserved. I'm looking for places to subtract points with this beer, and...I'm not finding them. Certainly, it's a big, bitter DIPA, and that might not be for everyone's palate.<br/>

<br/>
A: The ale is a copper color, a shiny penny. The ale is clear and has a lighter orange-yellow color at the narrower parts of the glass. The ale is amply carbonated, coating the sides of the glass with thick foam.<br/>
<br/>
S: The nose is loaded with hops, thick and resiny. Pine and grapefruit notes dominate, sickly sweet with a hint of tree. Not much balance, malt-wise though.<br/>
<br/>
T: The first sip reminded me of how delicious this ale is. The hops are blindingly bitter, sweet with grapefruit and citrus notes. A floral, herbal flavor, hop-driven, adds a unique sweetness to the ale. The ale is quite fragrant, loaded with hops and not ashamed about it. The caramel malts are most evident in the aftertaste, adding a graininess that mixes nicely with the hops.<br/>
<br/>
M: The mouthfeel is plucky, deceptive and enjoyable. The hop profile is the star of the ale.<br/>
<br/>
D: The 8% alcohol is hidden behind the Spector-esque wall of hops. A masterpiece.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=akorsak#review"">Nov 01, 2008</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/ozzylizard.757498/"">Ozzylizard</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.14</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-11.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>Bottled 111015 at 42 degrees into snifter<br/>

<br/>
Pours a amber-gold color with a decent head into my glass. Absolutely thrilling presentation for the style!<br/>
<br/>
Hints of grapefruit and tropical fruit tingle the nose. The malt stays in the background.<br/>
<br/>
Bursts of grapefruit and biscuity malt coat the mouth upfront. It's not too overpowering and the malt seems to balance it out.<br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel is full of lingering grapefruit, alcohol heat and biscuity malt. It's one of the most mellow examples I've had. <br/>
<br/>
It's excellent but quite honestly, it's certainly not THE best.

Notes of grapefruit, peach, pineapple, resin, and pine dominate the aroma, with lightly bready malt adding subtle sweetness. Tar and cannabis surface late.<br/>
<br/>
Flavor reveals resin throughout. There's an initial burst of slightly sweet tropical and citrus fruit, which leads to a grapefruit tart punch mid palate, and fades to a moderately bitter, resiny finish. A bit of tar surfaces in the aftertaste.<br/>
<br/>
Excellent example of the style. Well balanced bittering and flavoring hops, with good complexity.

Pours firm, nicely unfiltered and hazy with a big, soapy white head. Very nice pour for a Double IPA.<br/>
<br/>
Smells very nicely hoppy even 9 months after its bottling date. Huge hop complexity, no off nodes, no sense of it being excessive for the sake of being excessive, nice sweet malt backbone. Wonderful palette, wonderful balance. <br/>
<br/>
Tastes nearly as good as it smells. Starts off with a strong balance between the bittersweet, dry malt and the citrusy, piney hop profile. Malt is pleasantly buttery, not like diacetyl, more like a Ritz cracker. Really nice, and it's its unique malt profile--not, surprisingly, an especially complex hop profile--that makes it so tasty. <br/>
<br/>

Of course, living in the Midwest... I never expected to taste this Pliny rave. But coincidence had me in San Francisco's City Beer store and after they diligently went through my ""1001"" list told me that Pliny The Elder would be there at noon in two days. I showed up at the appointed time and bought three. I took one to a party that no one drank beer (lucky me again.) I took the two remainders home with one going to another party and I found a fast way to make friends. (I may keep the last one to trade on BA, but I may also hog it myself this week... lucky me.)<br/>
<br/>
Never has alcohol been concealed so well in a bitter beer... and never has the bitterness been so aromatic in my nose and linger so lightly on the tongue. Pliny will not convert me to the hophead ideology, but he has made me appreciate fully what I never thought I could.<br/>
<br/>
10/10/19 Also at SF's City Beer store (in their new digs), I bought two more copies. Hard as I might try, I could only change a few words in the above review; nor could I update my rating (certainly my highest rated IIPA and well above my average of 3.8.) At any rating, Pliny The Elder remains beer's Force Of Nature. However, I did read the Wikipedia article on Russian River and learned that it was started by Korbel Champagne and it has now opened a large menu brew-pub in Windsor. Am I ready for that ?<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=Beginner2#review"">Oct 15, 2016</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/ppoitras.4417/"">ppoitras</a></b> from Massachusetts</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.83</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>500ml bottle obtained via SS09 from vasdef42.

Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" golden beige head above the slightly cloudy golden amber brew. Pillowy head falls ever-so slowly, with sticky lasting lace. Aroma is stoutly of herbal and piney hops. Taste begins with a peek of bitter, goes sweet in the middle, and closes with bitterness and the hops character seen in the nose. Mouthfeel is super smooth, and drinkability is incredible. A beer this hoppy without providing nasty bitter face takes skill. This one is always a pleasure.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=ppoitras#review"">Dec 21, 2009</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/dar482.126309/"">dar482</a></b> from New York</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.47</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>The color is clear and light gold. It actually is really light in color.<br/>
<br/>
The aroma has some deep and dank pine sweetness. It is a floral bouquet with tons of tropical fruit with peach, pineapple, mango. There's some breadiness in there too. Deep in, it's just pure hops. It just puts off the acids of the hops that few beers can do.<br/>
<br/>
The flavor follows with pine, sweet mango, some tropical fruits. There then is a lingering bitterness that just cleans up the beer. The malt backbone is gentle, but strong enough to keep this beer balanced. The pine though is what stands out. It has a light malt body, tastes like pure juice, and stands out with lots of pine flavor as well as earthiness.<br/>
<br/>
And that's the word, balance. With the huge aroma, the complex hop characteristics, and then that malt backbone. This beer really has everything wonderful about Double IPAs. The alcohol is not there at all and this could even be mistaken for a regular IPA. <br/>
<br/>
Having had this again, the pine stands out for me, but it exemplifies the ""pure hoppiness"" of beers like Zombie Dust and Heady Topper. It attacks your teeth with the acidic hops.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, this does it better than other DIPAs, but is not a game changer. Still, sets the standard and is still a world class beer.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=dar482#review"">Feb 02, 2014</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/elnopalero.381612/"">elNopalero</a></b> from California</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.83</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+3%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Oh Pliny, how many ways can I enjoy you? I picked up a growler on my last visit to Russian River and didn’t get to it until a few days later. Still holds up—despite what the jokers say about it falling off minutes after being brewed. This pours a crystal golden color with a great Pliny aroma. Some straw and grass but mostly orange zest dominates the scent. The flavor has an incredible hop bite and bitterness. Straw and orange peel, with a pronounced bittering midpoint and a dry zesty finish. I enjoyed this until the last drop.<br/>

Must admit I surprised at how basic this beer looks in a glass, but I can smell the hops from 6 inches away, so that made up for it.<br/>
<br/>
Smells outstanding, like a handful of fresh picked hops; the pine and citrus notes up front are soft, sweet and juicy, like fresh citrus fruit mixed with lightly toasted grains. Aroma is sweet and hoppy overall, with fresh piney hops, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, lemon zest, citrus hops, toasted grains, tea leaf, grass, light caramel, floral hops, biscuit and light spices like pepper and coriander; the hops dominate, but don’t overpower the senses with just enough malt to make this near perfection. This is soft and inviting, yet completely hides the ABV and just begs you to take another whiff. <br/>
<br/>
Tastes magnificent: it is juicy, sweet and hoppy with fresh grapefruit, orange, lemon, pineapple, tangerine, citrus hops, piney hops, lightly toasted grains, caramel, floral hops, herbs, sweet malt, biscuit and spices like pepper, mint and coriander. Juicy citrus and tropical fruit flavors come in waves that swirl in a complex tornado, yet let the grains and malt add balance and flavor so it flows down easy with only hints of the alcohol peeking through. The ABV is masterfully contained and the piney and citrus hops smack you with bitterness and then hug you with warm, wonderful complex flavors. <br/>
<br/>
Mouthfeel is creamy and crisp at the same time, with a medium chewy body, average carbonation and a bitter finish that tasted like a glass of fresh squeezed tangerines. The citrus and grainy flavor that lingers are oily, but still on the dry side. It was like a coating of the delicious piney flavor purposely sticks around to remind you of how good each sip was and how good this beer is. <br/>
<br/>
A hop lovers dream, this lived up to the hype for the most part, but I think I need to try it out at the brewery to maximize the experience. I agree this is one of the best beers on the planet, as something so strong and flavorful should not be this easy to drink, yet this beer was so smooth that I had to hold myself back and force myself to sip it at times – it was that damn good. Incredibly easy to drink and extremely tasty, I am very happy that I was able to finally indulge in this world glass beer. A very high recommendation that I will seek out again and even travel to Northern California to have again – it’s that good.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=CHickman#review"">Sep 08, 2012</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/ktcamm.289047/"">KTCamm</a></b> from New Jersey</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.28</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-8.7%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4</span><br/><br/>7/19/18...on tap at Monks in Philadelphia. Pours bright gold, thick white foam. About 1/4 inch. Grapefruit malty nose,. Taste is even keeled, smooth grains and malts flow through. Super dry finish. Subtle but firm hop bitter. Pears and dried fruits are noted.

Clear amber with some bubbles rising but it's lighter than expected. The head is fluffy &amp; white, holding very well with good lacing too. The smell was a fresh &amp; hoppy one with floral notes &amp; a pleasant bitterness, some grapefruit at the end too but nothing overly pronounced. Citrus &amp; grapefruit kick off the taste with a freshness, faint pine &amp; subtle tropical fruits, most notably pineapple; the bitterness is slightly stronger here too. The body is strongly carbonated &amp; medium with a clean feel &amp; the alcohol content is hidden well too. Very nice &amp; easy to drink; not the best DIPA I've had but it is certainly up there.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=flyingpig#review"">Jan 07, 2020</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/emv.25570/"">EMV</a></b> from Pennsylvania</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.5</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#990000;"">-4.1%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5</span><br/><br/>Poured from the classic bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip<br/>
<br/>
L: Clear light to medium golden pour. 1 finger of foamy white head... falls fast with great lacing.<br/>
<br/>
S: Glorious hops... pine, resin, citrus and some herbal character.<br/>
<br/>
T/F: Strong but light malts, some bready flavors and a ridiculously complex and delicious bitter hop kick in the ass. Strong pine and herbal notes with lighter citrus and grapefruit. Peppercorn... slightly floral... smooth and oily on the tongue. Sticky in the aftertaste. Medium in body. Grapefruit on the aftertaste.<br/>
<br/>
O: A classic and a 'whale' for a reason. Just an all-around outstanding beer, and huge thanks to DEK196 for the hookup. One to savor and enjoy... and damn do I wish this had even occasional availability on the East Coast.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=EMV#review"">Jan 14, 2017</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>, <div id=""rating_fullview_content_2""><span class=""muted""><b><a class=""username"" href=""/community/members/larryi86.445106/"">larryi86</a></b> from Delaware</span><br/><br/><span class=""BAscore_norm"">4.97</span><span class=""rAvg_norm"">/5</span>  rDev <span style=""color:#006600;"">+6%</span><br/><span class=""muted"">look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5</span><br/><br/>Thanks you PlinyTheKid for bottles<br/>
500 mL bottle dated 1/24/2011 poured into a snifter<br/>
<br/>
A- A clear orange/copper color with a two finger white head, nice lacing.<br/>
<br/>
S- HOPS! Grapefruit/citrus hops, pineapple/tropical hops, some piney hops.<br/>
<br/>
T- Just as hoppy as the smell. The hops flavors are balanced like in the smell. Nice solid sweet malt backbone which gives a perfect balance to the bitterness of the hops.<br/>
<br/>
M- Silky smooth, crisp, refreshing, and nice medium body.<br/>
<br/>
D- This has everything I would want in an IIPA. Great hops flavor. This is very easy to drink for 8% ABV and very enjoyable. I wish I could get this by me, so good.<br/><br/><span class=""muted""><a href=""/beer/profile/863/7971/?ba=larryi86#review"">Feb 20, 2011</a></span>  <a ba-action=""flag"" class=""comment_flag Tooltip"" href=""#"" onclick=""return false;"">Report</a></div>]"
