A lighter style of beer. Nice.Aug 02, 2021', '3.75Overall good, but fairly 1-dimensional. A good hint of chocolate and earthy licorice, but it still retains some lightness. A nice cross between a more refreshing feel and darker flavors.Jun 24, 2021', '3.75Unknown age bottle into a pint glass. Dark mahogany red color, clear and crisp, really nice multi layer head with a fine smooth cap and rich hearty bubbles retained in a 1 finger head 10 minutes after the pour. Really nice nose here, rich sweet chocolate malt, lager yeast, pecan pie, and cinnamon. The taste is all caramel, chocolate, mulling spice, and finishing on a sweet cacao note that lingers on the palate with a touch of lager grass. The mouthfeel is a touch thin, but it is crisp and clean like a lager should be.\n\nI have had better dark lager but it is a hard style to get right, and this is a great, albeit a touch sweet, attempt.Jun 08, 2021', '4I like this beer, it’s subtly different. \nDark yet transparent brownish red. Medium bodied. Nice lacy tan head that clings to the glass. A funky, but not off putting aroma, I find common in some sour beers.

Darkest black imaginable, 40+. A fluffy, creamy light tan head well retained. Appears very thin.\n\nS: A milky chocolate, almost as light as white chocolate upfront, followed by light hints of coffee. Gummy candy like black liquorice. Perhaps notes of caramel slightly. All subtle and malted around.\n\nT: The first sip was phenomenal. SO complex it is hard to point to any one flavor. Earthy, yet not like a barnyard, more of a fecund field about to be seeded. Light roasted malt and coriander sweeten up to milk chocolate tones, that gives way to a biscuity, buttery finish. Lager yeast taste, most akin to a schwarzbier but with more to contemplate.\n\nF: Pleasantly lightweight and clean. Lowly carbonated and hopped.\n\nThere was nothing in this beer that was added to distract from the beer, it was a full and honest experience. The midnight black color with a viscosity as low as water allows it to go down super smooth and quenching. The nose is deep and warm, long drawnout and on the palate there is a barrage of flavor. Sweet chocolate and malt, ever slightly dank by the classic lager crispness. For those who love the smells and tastes of heavy dark warmers, but enjoy the clean, straightforward feel of lagers.Jan 16, 2021', '3.75Nice foamy head,, good lacing, can definitely taste the malt and the spice.

A nice foamy tan head gives way to decent off-white lacing.\n\nVery mild roasted malt and chocolate aromas along with a touch of earthy hop.\n\nThe brew is deceptively malty/sweet on the front end. Good herbal and roasted notes in midstream help offset it, giving way to mild berry notes before the finish. The finish is a bit woody and delivers just a touch of bittering.\n\nThe feel is excellent. Medium bodied, well carbonated, and very smooth. \n\nOne of my favorite New Belgium brews, and a great dark lager.Dec 20, 2020"", '4The pour is mocha colored with a beige head that is not as thick & frothy as I expected a beer of this style should be. The taste is mild roasted malt, whole wheat crackers, & a mild dark chocolate note that appears more towards the finish.

The head recedes slowly to a fluffy cap and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is mild with cocoa powder being the most prominent. The taste follows with semisweet cocoa and nutty / earthy notes and little finishing bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, good.Jul 20, 2020', ""4.25*Poured into a Teku glass from a 12oz bottle*\n\nThis beer poured a coffee dark brown, it almost looked like a stout but it wasn't as dark. There were a lot of fast rising bubbles, making this look almost like a coke. This also had a nice khaki colored half finger thick head, but it was relatively weak, having a low retention to it.\n\nUpfront, the aroma on this gave me rich notes of chocolate, biscuit, and caramel. Kind of reminded me of a milk chocolate covered biscuit.\n\nThe taste on this consisted of roasty sweet malts upfront with notes of mellow chocolate and biscuits. In the middle and end, the beer tasted of cold brew coffee which lingered for a bit in the aftertaste. I thought that this was fairly clean tasting and had no notable bitterness while there was also a bit of an ethanol note in the back-end, but it wasn't super noticeable. This was just a nice and mellow tasting beer balanced out with notes of chocolate, dark coffee, and bread.\n\nI thought that this felt very soft, clean and crisp, ticking all the marks on a really good lager. This felt pretty medium bodied and had a medium to high amount of carbonation to it. I thought this was very easy, super smooth, and mellow, contributing to its overall drink-ability.\n\nI love both stouts and lagers. So I just knew that I would love this style of beer. I can confidently say that this now goes on my list of one of the better lagers I've had.Jul 17, 2020"", '4Dark brown appearance with a large, off white head and good lacing. Toasted malt aroma of nuts, licorice and toffee. Smooth, earthy flavors duplicated the aroma, maybe a little heavier with the caramel malts and the nuttiness more evident in the aftertaste. Affable offering from a reliable brewery.Jul 03, 2020', ""3.75This one is pretty decent for a dark lager. It's not too complex, but is a nice dark beer to finish off the evening. \n\nLook: Dark ruby red in color. Light tan head that dissipates pretty quickly. Typical of a dark lager. \n\nSmell: Pretty much all malt here. A bit roasty and bready, and the lager yeast comes through just a bit. \n\nTaste: Similar to the smell, bready, and roasty. Just bitter enough to compliment the sweetness, but it isn't offensive in any way. The lager yeast works pretty well with the flavors in this beer and doesn't stand out so much, so even if you don't like lagers you might consider giving this one a try. A simple taste, but compliments sweets very well. \n\nFeel: Despite the low ABV and dark color, it actually doesn't taste completely watery as I was afraid it would. It's no stout or porter, but it's full bodied enough to match the color. It still could be a bit thicker, but it gets the job done. \n\nOverall: This beer is pretty solid. While it won't wow or amaze you, it's better than most other light brown ales/dark lagers I've had. Definitely would consider buying again!May 26, 2020"", '3.75I had this twice in December 2016 when a guest left a couple of bottles after a party (poker probably). On Untappd at the time, I wrote that it featured ""roasted malt"" and was ""slightly sweet."" In another checkin, I claimed that it was more stout than lager, which is a good thing if you ask me.

#9,Fruit and Field Beer,Magic Hat Brewing Company,5.1,3.42,"[""3.75It's a shame they are no longer at their Burlington, VT spot because I wish I could visit the once popular home to this wonderful serum. Anyways, a bronze liquid fills my glass with a foamy white head. Fairly standard appearance, but a wonderful aroma of apricot/fruity sweetness permeates the glass. A sip and you quite literally are mystified by this beer. What am I drinking? It's got a sweet flavor to it with an almost malty touch. A really crisp clean beer that is unique and hard to describe, but really what it is is delicious.Jul 21, 2021"", '5This is a solid beer that tastes reminded me of my first taste of home-brewed IPA: more floral fragrant with prevalent apricot notes. One of my favorite all-time recommendations, but maybe not for everyone’s palette if into heavy or bitter brews.May 19, 2021', '3.512oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 9/9/290, so 8 months old.\n\nFaintly hazy pale amber body. No head retention, hence no lacing.\n\nNot much of an aroma. Somewhat fruity.\n\nOn tasting, the fruit is there, with a fairly strong sour bitterness.\n\nMouth medium, finish sour bitterness \n\nOverall, none too pleasant to this palate, and I dont think its age related.May 16, 2021', ""3.5Beer pours a little cloudy with a little head, and a few small particulates. Smells more like a fruity ale than an IPA (which I like). tastes pretty good in my opinion, but not as hoppy as a pale ale( perhaps that's why it says not quite pale ale on the front). It's like your average run of the mill ale, but just a bit more fruity and a light hop flavor towards the end. The carbonation is mild, not smooth like nitro brews, but relatively soft. Overall I could drink em all day and not be sick of the taste, but it would be my first choice if I was looking to only drink a beer or two after dinner. That being said if I see them in the custom six pack fridge I would be okay with adding one of these.Feb 28, 2021"", ""4A definite rich color and apricot/fruit smell. It claims it's not quite an ale, and it feels like it needs a bit more in the hoppy department to even out the fruit flavor. With all that said, if on a hot day you need something not hoppy and not a lager, this works quite well as an evening drink after a day in the yard.Nov 12, 2020"", ""3.25Brewed by Dundee under the FIFCO USA portfolio this beer has been one of the crossover recommendations I have for someone who is looking to get into crafted beer - granted this is a bit more pedestrian than it used to be - today this is still a delightful medium-bodied semi-hoppy fruit-inspired beer. \n\nIf you're at a recently poured pint the coloring may pique your interest, as the hue doesn't remind me of a typical fruit beer, but a pale ale as listed on the bottle. I do get a lot more malt than I formerly recalled in the back notes, front notes are sweet fruit and ale yeast. You do get a bit of a sticky sweetness factor in the finish, but that isn't entirely bad.May 27, 2020"", ""3.7512oz bottle - over a year old - poured into a squat pint and fridge temp.\n\nPours a somewhat darker amber hue, quite clear, and topped with a finger of tam head that recedes quickly. \n\nNose: Caramel malt lends some sweet bready notes with toffee and caramel and plenty of resinous hops bring some pine, grass, and hugely fruity aroma with notes of apricot, papaya, and peach rings. This is categorised as a fruit and field beer, so I'm wondering if there's some peach or something in here. Also a slight herbal spice note, like fresh oregano. \n\nPalate: Crazy dry out of the gate. Given the sweet malty aroma, i was expecting something cloying and sticky, but that isn't the case here. There is some crystal malt flavour, but it's amidst some very pale malt and grainy wheat. There is some subtle hopping, lending a nondescript floral and fruity character, and then a clear sign of there being some fruit in here. I'm guessing mango. Ive had other mango IPAs, and this is very similar. If it isn't mango, it's some other stone fruit - peach, apricot, nectarine, etc.. but my guess is mango. Some lightly bitter and highly floral hop resins in the finish with that stine fruit becoming even bigger before a quick, clean, abrupt finish. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: Medium-light in body, very crisp, snappy, and refreshing, with lower effervescence. It feels fairly dry elevating the crisp drinkability. Slightly drying hoppy finish. Clean.\n\nOverall: So I'm convinced there's a fruit in it, I'm just not sure what. Mango? Apricot? It reminds me a lot of Ffirst Cut from Troegs. Nevertheless, it's actually quite enjoyable, crisp, and refreshing, and would be easy to drink a couple of these in rapid succession. It also clearly holds up well. It isn't something I'd go out of my way for and I certainly wouldn't trade for it, but for a cheap shelf beer, I like it.Apr 26, 2020"", ""3.75Poured from bottle, hardly any head. Copper in color, mildly hazy. It smells like straight up flowers, definitely one of the best smelling ales out there. The taste isn't as good as the smell, but it's still delicious.

The taste is apricot as well. I was also able to taste a hint of cherry in there as well. Others I know have commented that as well, but then others do not taste the cherry flavor. I like this beer though. Has that fruit flavor, but it is not overpowering by any means. That is good for me because I am not a fan of super fruity bears.

Had a brown colored half-finger thick head but had little to no retention to it, but considering the age and ABV, it was pretty understandable.\n\nThe aroma was very barrel forward, you can definitely get a big hit of bourbon, ethanol, and oaky notes upfront. There were soft notes of leather, dark fruits, burnt caramel, vanilla, and toffee in the middle and back-end, but the beer was so barrel forward that these aromas were a bit subdued. Maybe some age will mellow out the bourbon and alcohol aromas and let the other notes shine.\n\nIn terms of the flavor profiles, I felt like the taste followed the nose for the most part. Delicious and complex, I also found that this beer struck a nice balance between the sweet/caramel notes of the malt and the boozy/earthiness of the bourbon oak barrel. You get the bourbon and the oakiness upfront, which eventually just dissipates to a bourbon flavor and dark cherries in the middle. Towards the end, I got a bit of the burnt caramel, toffee, and vanilla characters which left a combination of a sweet and bitter aftertaste, though the bitterness wasn't strong at all.\n\nThis beer was medium to full bodied with light carbonation. Again, this had a sweet and bitter aftertaste which lingered for a while, but the flavors weren't super bold or strong.\n\nI felt like this was a very sold representation of a barrel-aged English Barleywine style. Big malty characters of caramel and toffee, but the flavors were balanced with the booziness and earthiness of the bourbon and oak.

Although, unusual for an IPA, Dogfish has a winner in this one.Aug 27, 2021', ""4.5I recognize that I am late to this party; having 15 from Dogfish, but having avoided the 120 Minutes... being a malt-head.\nBut, what was I worrying about ?\n\nWhat brought me here was that 120 is on BA's Beers of Fame. And while I had closed in on 2/3 of the Fames, I avoided the easy hoppy hits... and 120 is among them. So after I got a copy that was bottled two years ago, I cellared it until I was mature enough to appreciate better what it is that the hopheads want. I'm not sure I am truly more mature and still do not know what hopheads want, but now was the time to start. I popped its famous top. But first, a comment on what hot water does.\n\n120 Minutes is a long time to boil anything. From a culinary perspective, remember it is a long 10 minutes for fettuccine (which depends on the sauce) and 8 minutes to hard-boil an egg (one of the most nutritiously intense things you can eat.) So if you boil something 120 minutes, you better be producing something special.\n\nAnd of course, Dogfish did. 120 Looks like not IIPA I can remember seeing, a beautiful amber. The Smells, Tastes and Feel all are integrated by a dedication to using hops to balance malt. \n\nDespite this being my 16th Dogfish, I suspect I've never done them a micro-review... now into its second year of ownership by Boston Beer, the Big Popi of the craft beer movement. How that plays out will mostly be for the Good. For as a purchase, Dogfish understand brewing's depth. Dogfish is active in all three traditions (probably excelling in two.) It has combined brewing with thoughtful kitchen menus for 25 years and it built a 15 room Inn (brining in the British tradition.) And then, it opened a second shop in Miami, tourism central, just to prove its point. \n\nAll that said, I think that only a few second generation crafters (20th Century) are as visionary as Dogfish and, when the final analysis is done, Dogfish may be second to none. A good purchase by Boston.

Today I saw it pop on the shelves because of yesterday's date, so it's time to revisit. \n\nThe beer pours a very lovely caramel colour, hints of gold and amber mix to create a hue that is eye catching. A natural suspension of yeast floats throughout the ale, though fine in density.

A scent of juicy hop resins suggest this beer has been dry hopped in its finish. Deep within the smell are malt notes, but no real alcohol notes. \n\nFlavour profile is a classic west coast style pale ale, large ibu notes in the mid-30's(?) are a bit rounded by the malt-complexity of the beer. I do get a bit of a wheat note, but it is subtle and the hops really come through and whatever is used on the dry hopping is the most pronounced throughout the beer. At 5.7% ABV this is highly drinkable, very full bodied, with a medium mouth feel. The hopping, at least to me, doesn't create a overly bitter finish but you can tell you've consumed a pale ale. I am assuming this is the same house yeast strain used in their wheat blueberry beer Blue, as both the wheat notes and finish are similar in mouthfeel. \n\nHighly drinkable and would go well with BBQ, cheese plates, long talks, someone playing Wonderwall, or throwing bags drinking this out of a red solo cup.Apr 21, 2021"", '3.75Pours a clear golden yellow with a white cap that lingers and leaves nice lacing.

The hops are gently citrusy, leafy, herbal, piney, and spicy. The leafy and herbal qualities enhance the malt & maple syrup while the citrus, pine, and spice lend it contrast and an additional balance beyond the bitterness that\'s there. It\'s medium-full in the mouth with a delicate bristle of carbonation before warming to become smooth and creamy. It\'s an interesting beer. It\'s pretty big (how strong is it? 7.5%) and a bit sweet but it\'s completely balanced.

Right off the bat I get a whiff of ruddy caramel malts, some candy aroma. The hop aroma is more herbal than piney. Some citrus aroma, and hints of blueberry. The taste is on the malt side, the hops really don't jump out off this one. Rasberry black tea like flavor. Pie crust. Refreshing flavor, just slightly chewy. Lingering malt finish. The alcohol is well concealed. This is such an easy drinking beer. I always referred to it as a classic east coast IPA (before the whole hazy New England IPA thing). It doesn't have the bitter hop astringency or tropical flavors of for example a Lagunitas or Green Flash west coast IPA. Rather this beer is bordering on being a light barleywine. Darken it just a tad more and up the abv and it woud be into barleywine territory.\n\nOverall, not quite as good as I remember, but still very good.

I prefer Brewer\'s Art\'s ""Resurrection"".Jun 16, 2019', '3.75The second Dubbel and moving to an American version of the beer with Brewery Ommegang Abbey Ale.\n\nLet’s dig in!\n\nThis beer is similar in color to the Westmalle with dark and light brown throughout, but I find it’s a slightly lighter colored beer with some reddish hues as well. The color of the head is less so beige and more off white. It is opaque and there is no visible carbonation. The head leaves some lacing on the glass and settles to a thin layer across the top with a thick ring around the edge of the goblet. The carbonation rises much faster with this one. \n\nThe aroma on this beer is more muted than the Westmalle. There is definitely some sweetness to the beer, but it’s different. The orange citrus comes through and the dried fruit aromas are white raisin and fresh apricot as opposed to dark raisins and dried apricots. Nothing screams licorice but the aroma seems more spicy to me with some cinnamon. It’s also very earthy, with some black tea like the Westmalle. \n\nThe flavor is less complex than the Westmalle, and my initial impression is that I thoroughly enjoy the Belgian-made beer more. Some dry, sweet bready notes that fall off pretty quickly, but it’s a less fully flavored beer. Limited malt sweetness / complexity to the beer as noted in the Westmalle. The finish is also semi/dry, but I’m not getting any bitterness here, making for a more one dimensional drinking experience. Some woody notes that actually remind me a bit of oak/vanilla notes from bourbon\n\nThe feel is very nice. Soft carbonation. \n\nThis is a very good beer. None of the orange, licorice, or spice jump off the page. This is a good thing. These additions manifest themselves subtly. They never detract from the beer, and create a unique flavor profile. For me, the malt profile of this beer, and the beer overall, is just not as complex as the Westmalle. While I think this one is very good with no problems, I prefer the other.Jun 16, 2019', '4.25Chocolate color with a 1F head in an Orval Trappist glass.\nWonderful spice and cherry.\nRelatively smooth MF.\nDeep spice, cherry, and some chocolate in the taste.\nModerate hoppy finish.\nFor some reason, I haven’t tasted this beer.\nIt’s excellent and one of the better Dubbels.Jun 16, 2019', '4.25Amazingly, don’t think I had tried this before.

The hop flavors that come through are earthier than the nose suggested they would be, but with an almost tropical juiciness that can be detected as well. It's a nice mix of flavors and fun to break down, but also the malt bill can't quite hold up to them and the beer tends to finish overly bitter and feels pretty weak and unbalanced. This of course is what they were going for, but without the balance, sessionability can be negatively effected due to the richness of those hops.

The taste was mostly bitter but lead to a nice semi-sweet citrus-ness concerning itself to try to run itself about a nice aftertaste and ended up leading to a fairly same finish. On the palate, this one shows a nice sessionable quality running about it and still lends a hand to a nice carbonation running about its body and shows that there is nothing overbearing of the sorts on any end.

It\'s more sour than I expected, and while malty flavors attempt to calm things down in the form of a bread crust backbone and a sweet, caramel finish, the differing tastes don\'t balance. The aftertaste has an odd, mint leaf quality, which is mismatched with even more malt: this time, it\'s a crackery bill. \n\nM: The syrupy mouthfeel matches the murkiness of the beer\'s appearance.

When we got home, I opened the bottle and took a sniff. It was the most incredible thing I've ever smelled, and it smelled like a lot of things at once - all of them great. I was allowed a two-finger filled glass, as I was still a kid. I tried so hard to drink it, but I wasn't used to the bitterness of beer, so I couldn't finish the amount in the glass.

Distinctly hoppy and resinous flavour, better than the aroma, not too sweet, with a solid bitterness in the finish.Dec 12, 2020', '4.25This beer changed my palate! I was drinking a lot of Sculpin and maltier IPAs and then this...that dank, garlicky, something different. \n\nYes, Big Eye brings big IPA flavor to the table and is bold and different.

Seemed a little darker, although I didn't look at them side by side. Similar look; fine sediment makes an otherwise almost transparent beer look slightly cloudy. More active carbonation in this one, tall fluffy off-white head which leaves significant lacing. Again, the taste is very hop forward with smooth piney citrus and has some of the same flavours as the Sculpin; again there is no astringent bitterness but the taste ends with a mild earthy spiciness.

This beer is very unapologetic about the hops, it is the type of IPA that celebrates the hops itself, rather than focusing on hiding a multitude of subtle flavors under the hops (while those flavors are still there). The angle that I would describe the flavors as is earthy, with a nice welcoming, musky scent as you go to drink.Aug 04, 2017', '4The appearance was always a nice somewhat hazy golden transparent color with a decent one and a half fingered white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace and left some nice somewhat foamy clingy lacing. The smell was a bit earthy and dry bitter to sweet citrus hops. Honestly, I kinda thought it was somewhat like those sweet citrusy hops were covered by malts and combined in the boil. Still, I liked it for the most part. The taste was balanced through the hops and malts adequately and showed a decent bitter to sweet aftertaste that lead into a somewhat dry finish. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium with a nice sessionable aspect leading my taste buds onward and enthused to try a bit more of this wonderful brew coating my mouth and tongue.

Much of the dark fruit and fig found in the 10 year bottle are subdued by the hops here.\nTaste: Similar to the nose, very very hoppy, and many of the complexities are hidden by the intense hopping. I can see the criticisms of this as a barleywine, though to my palate I still find this very enjoyable fresh. Dark fruit is still found somewhere buried beneath the hops.\nFeel: Well carbonated and full.\nOverall: This is a much hoppier beer than the aged bottle, which I still thought was hoppy compared to an English Barleywine. Still a fantastic beer, and amazing how different its qualities change as it ages. Truly one of the best beers for aging, and still just as impressive (though different and perhaps less true to style) fresh.\n------------------------\n01/08/2021:\n2011 (10 year vintage)\nLook: Pours a dark copper with decent head and lacing.\nSmell: Smell is dominated by heaps of malts and hops. Caramel, fig, dark fruits.\nTaste: Similar to the nose, big on hops and caramel malts. Quite sweet with a big hop presence to ""balance"" the heavy malt bill as you\'d expect from a Sierra Nevada barleywine, though it\'s understandable that this is not everyone\'s preference.\nFeel: This 2011 bottle is still a thick beer, though I think a fresher bottle would score better here.\nOverall: For a 10-year-old beer it\'s still delicious all things considered, but I do think it would have been better if enjoyed a few years sooner. In terms of the beer itself, it\'s a big beer that can certainly be polarizing particularly to those who prefer milder versions of the American barleywine style, but it\'s one that I personally find quite enjoyable from time to time.Jan 09, 2021', '4.25Bigfoot 2021\n\nPoured the 12 oz. bottle (packaged 11/25/20) into a chalice with a deep amber (dark red in sunlight) color with very little head and minimal lacing. Smells of piney hops, dark fruit and sweet malt. Flavor follows the aroma with bitter hops, raisins, earthy bread and strong malts. Full bodied with good carbonation. Pleasantly warming with a balance toward the hops, similar to a strong IPA. Very good hoppy BW.Jan 08, 2021', '4Pours from the bottle a rich, clear mahogany, 1"" creamy head that slowly recedes leaves some moderate lacing. Nose off the bat is strong resinous hops, pine, grapefruit, citrus peel, rounder sweeter malts, fresh baked brown bread, baking spice, a hint of green bell pepper. Taste is very hop forward, with rich, resinous, hop oils drowning out nearly all other flavors. There\'s a strong tannic, bitter aftertaste that lingers as well, blocking any sweeter, maltier flavors out. In many ways, this is plays like a TIPA with its hoppy intensity. As it warms, the bitterness remains dominant, but the sugars play up a bit more. Mouthfeel is full and unctuous, but the lively carbonation prevents it from becoming a slog to drink. Not much balance to this, but as a hop-dominant sipper it does the trick.Dec 20, 2020', '1.5Re-review 2020. This is a 2017 vintage I\'m having tonight, and I figured 3 years would have tapered off the harshness of the hops, and helped this beer mellow out a bit, even as a very hoppy American Barleywine. \n\nPours a dark oxidized caramel color with an egg foam yellow head of 1/2 finger. \n\nAroma of hop oils, perfume, alcohol, golden raisin, dark raisin, and caramel. \n\nFlavor is candy vitamins, oxidized hops, raisin, resin, hop oils, and yellowed hop leaves.\n\nFeel is hot and scathing, medium bodied and thinning out on the palate. Heat remains. \n\nOverall, I have never liked this beer, got it as an ""extra"" in a trade, and figured I\'d give it one more shot. It turns out this is still an awful hoppy mess - and I\'m a huge hop head now. It\'s not balanced in any regard, and is on the lowest of the low for barleywine beers. So gross. I can drink the heaviest triple IPAs, but this thing is just a fucking gross mess. It is a total drain pour. Zero balance to this beer whatsoever. Like drinking straight hop oils. It\'s the biggest head shaker for me on highly regarded commercial craft beer.\n\n--------------------------\n3/22/2017\n\nYear : 2016. \n\nIt starts off great with a pour of mahogany and burnt caramel. The head is egg foam yellow and towering above the woody body. \n\nOn the label it talks about a lot of cone hops, but that\'s about all I smell when nosing this particular BW. This comes off more as a quadruple iPA in the aroma. Onion, grapefruit, garlic. Hits of caramel. \n\nSN\'s Barleywine drinks like a hoppy, oily mess. I realize the American Barleywine style is hoppier than the English counterpart, but this is just a cop out. Dump a bunch of hops into the boil and use a touch of caramel malts along with the huge pale malt bill and there you have it. It\'s total vidalia onion, awful grapefruit, and a garbage-caramel gross sweetness. Awful.\n\nI just can\'t quit disliking this beer. Feel is slick and oily, all the way down. Not boozy, not alcoholic, just a resiny mess. \n\nOverall a very disconnected, one trick hop-blasted beer that drinks more like a super hop infused malt liquor. It\'s disgusting. I\'ll probably never return to this beer since it\'s turned me off so badly! To style? This beer is a fat ass F. It\'s an IPA if anything, and barleywine-ignorant-hopheads with scrubbed palates are the only reason this beer gets any credit.\n\n1.69 / 5Aug 10, 2020', '4Pours a mahogany color with some black cherry highlights.

I am getting secondary notes of dark fruits like stewed black cherries and plums, nice sweet almond marzipan and creamy vanilla aromas also. A bit of spice comes through also. I got some metallic notes too, but I think that they blew off eventually. Overall, the aromas aren't super expressive but definitely present and accessible. I've heard other people describe previous vintages of this beer to smell like chocolate cake and I totally agree with that.\n\nTaste: Wow, this is very nice. Not quite what I expected, and very enjoyable. Up front, it's hard to describe the flavors. Lots of generic roastiness without much sweetness. Some fruity and nutty notes up front as well. On the finish, there are lots of chocolate and coffee flavors. Huge robust baker's chocolate notes with some pleasant dryness and bitterness. The bitterness doesn't taste like it is coming from hops, rather it seems like is coming from the unsweetened chocolate flavors that are coming from the roasted malts. It's very complex and interesting and I find that after sipping it and savoring it, there is even more to appreciate. There is a tinge of acidity on the back end as well. It's almost an afterthought because it doesn't even cross your mind - the 10.0% ABV is completely undetected.\n\nFeel: This RIS has some nice chewiness to it and the carbonation is moderate, really spot on for this type of beer. Mouthfeel is just a bit thin.\n\nOverall: This is a solid russian imperial stout. It is delicious now and I think that cellaring for a year or a few years would only enhance and help develop and round out the flavors.

Up front is bitter dark chocolate and malt. Maybe a roasted nuttiness is there as well. Hops come through. There's something like a dark Belgian thing going on in the background. \n\nConsistency is very good! Not thin and not crazy thick. It's oily and some of the bitter flavors linger on the palate for a while.\n\nOverall this is a great beer for the money, and a good beer in spite of the price point.

Black Note Stout,Stout - American Imperial,Bell's Brewery - Eccentric Café & General Store,11.2,4.57,"[""4335ml bottle - 2017 Vintage (10/05/2017) - poured into a balloon glass at 50°F. \n\nPours a deep, dark mahogany brown, sitting absolutely inky jet black in the glass. A super short head of coarse dark tan bubbles forms, before quickly receding to a razor-thin, but,persistent collar.\n\nNose: Definitely that Bell's barrel-aged aroma here. Much like BA Expo, which makes up half of this, there's a big, dense fudgy aroma, with plenty of dark cocoa-like roast, caramel, and marzipan, with secondary notes of American tobacco, vanilla, leather, and bourbon barrel. There are some signs of age here - mildly faded aroma, as well as some unique notes - musty, a whisper of umami, with a hint of fresh spearmint, and a metallic penny note as well, the latter of which is slightly detracting, but only slightly.\n\nPalate: Black Note greets the palate malt-first, with a moderate sweetness. Dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, toffee, roasted malts, and a surprising fruitiness. Big plummy dark fruit notes - mainly prune, plum, dried cherry, and bourbon-y apple lend a bright fruity pop, with a touch of acidity. This dark fruit element cuts through much of the malty sweetness, creating a shortcut for the roastiness to come in. Dark malts, barrel char, roast, and cacao nib begin to build a mild-moderate bitterness, and the bourbon character begins to bloom. At this point, it begins to dry out fast, roast taking over the sweetness, and dark fruits fading, as the beer barrels towards a finish with nutty malted milk, hazelnut, cocoa powder, a bit of black roast, barrel char, and ultimately concludes with dry oak and a lingering vanilla cream note.\n\nBody: I cannot say whether or not this is the age, but this one is definitely thin. Unlike BA Expo, or even Vanilla Black Note (which was not a super thick stout), this one is definitely a little runny, lacking any and all chew or viscosity. Definitely some effervescence, and it's fairly full (perhaps medium-full) bodied, but it's very fluid and thin. \n\nOverall: With Barrel-Aged Expedition being a personal favourite of mine, I had high hopes for this one. I'm thinking maybe BA Expo is really just the best qualities of this in one thread. It's a perfectly delicious bourbon barrel-aged stout, with a particularly fine malt balance and unique creamy nuttiness, but with its subdued aroma, dry delivery, and ultra-thin body, it falls short for me. Super drinkable, if that's what you want, but I find the Vanilla variant far superior, and BA Expo to be the ultimate expression.Dec 28, 2020"", ""4.252017 vintage. Pours jet black, small-medium head.\n\nAroma is full of roast. Taste is roast and chocolate, with a bit of barrel hanging on.\n\nThe beer is still smooth, but if you have any left from '17, drink them now.

Recedes to a fingernail with some remaining bubbles on top. \n\nAroma is chock full of tobacco and fig, with some dry bakers cacao and piney hop right behind it. Lots of roasted malt and karo syrup as well. \n\nFlavor brings dry cigarette ash mingled with dry cacao and hints of chocolate. Some raisin and pine follow up shortly after. Finish is of leather, grass, very dry bakers cacao, and hints of raisin. I do not get any bourbon barrel.\n\nFeel is slick with a heavy carbonation and a boozy burn though not too much. Slick, resinous finish. \n\nOverall, this beer fared better for me this time and fares a lot better than many 4 year old beers. This is absolutely a good beer, but the Vanilla Black Note is way better. \n\nPrice paid : $5.99 / bottle in 2016\nWould buy again : Yeah I'd give it a swing\n\n\n\nInitial review : \n\nJanuary 15th, 2017\n\nOily black with a beige-brown head. \n\nAroma of old moldy oak barrel, meat locker, snuff tobacco, leather, cigarette butts, and slight vinegar. \n\nFlavor is a touch milky to start (somewhat thin), but then forms a bit more character with tobacco, earth, and finally on the finish it all comes together - bourbon, rich chocolate, oats, and leather on the aftertaste. \n\nFeel is thin to start, then begins a medium profile, and finally a thick juicy finish with a roasty dryness. \n\nOverall, this is the 2nd 2016 bottle I've had this year, and I remember the first one being better. This seems to have some issues regarding smelling a bit vinegary and ashy, with the flavor really lacking until the finish. I remember the first bottle being flavorful all the way through. Sad, but I have one more bottle I can take care of yet before my 2016 stash is depleted. \n\nRated with price in mind ($6/bottle).\n\n4.25 / 3.75 / 4 / 3.75 / 4 = 3.93Aug 17, 2020"", ""4.5Pretty high bar to set, describing it as sharing qualities with Expedition and the feel of Double Cream. Also a beer that I've long wanted to try. But my first experience largely lived up to the high billing.\n\nJet black body with cola-brown edges. Not as viscous or thick as I expected, but it's certainly a big and bold looking stout. Handsome mocha cap of latte head that collapses quite quickly but leaves a strong circumferential ring of chocolate foam that provides spotty lacing down the glass. Swirls of the glass produce moderate alcohol legs and renewed mocha film that compliments the jet black coloring extremely well.\n\nThe aroma and taste profile is as expected, with huge bursts of dark chocolate, roasty and toasty malts, divine dark fruits, exotic woods, licorice, brown sugar, and barrel char. The nose is masterfully layered, with no single note dominating and each whiff leading with something different. On the tongue you get an added streak of whiskey heat and molasses sweetness, with strong barrel personality -- toffee, oak, and a little maple -- standing out. There's perhaps just a tad too much black licorice for my liking, but that's pretty nit-picky. It's not a sweet stout, at all, but the semi-sweetness and strong bitterness balance each other out beautifully.\n\nFeel is thinner than I expected and was hoping for (especially given the Double Cream reference), but it's incredibly smooth and silky with just a wee bit of stickiness. Reasonably carbonated and very little boozy heat.Jan 25, 2020"", '5Vintage 2016\n\nThe pour is black. The taste is bittersweet chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, char, mild prune, & tobacco.

Black Tuesday,Stout - American Imperial,The Bruery,19.5,4.59,"[""5Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin.

This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father.

Reviewed 2/16/20.\n2016 Edition. Etched on the shoulder above the rear label “B#3501 9/8/16” above “09:31 000906”. Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees (as stated on the label) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.9 degrees F.\nAppearance – 3.\nFirst pour – Medium brown, clear.\nBody – Dark brown/black, opaque. When held to direct light, brown around the top edge. \nHead – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles fizzing away, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin complete ring of tiny bubbles, fed by aggressive effervescence. \nLacing – None, not unexpected at 20.3% ABV.\nAroma – 4 - Has an almost weak, watery dark fruit aroma with some weak wood and possibly bourbon in the background, but I must really horn it to pick up the bourbon.\nFlavor – 4 – This begins somewhat sweet with weak flavors of “dark fruit’’ with raisins being weakly predominant and prunes trailing behind. Dates are weakly present. No alcohol (20.3% ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor, but massive numbing of the tongue and soft palate occurs as it warms while being held in the mouth. No alcohol on the exhale, oddly enough. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops.\nPalate – 4 – Medium, just short of syrupy, lively carbonation.\nFinal impression and summation: 4. Like the Chicxulub meteor, this burns all the way down my esophagus before striking my gastric mucosa, leaving a massive crater and wiping out all the helicobacter dinosaurs in my own, personal, mass extinction event. Otherwise, the flavors are subdued and blended to the point of making it difficult to separate individuals from the background salmagundi, providing a coherent and cogent synthesis of deep fruity flavors, sans wood or bourbon. Appearance is totally average: brown black, no head, but somehow looks less viscous than Old Engine Oil (of which I’ll soon be drinking sixers). Overall, a decent delivery system for high levels of alcohol. I capped the bottle while I can still make those decisions.Feb 16, 2020', ""4.52009 vintage - poured from a 750mL bottle into a small snifter. \n\nBistre body with very little carbonation producing a tiny khaki collar; fast running tears; poor retention.\n\nDeep, sweet, fruit-heavy, rich aromatics with molasses, prunes, figs, toasted sugar, and faint tobacco. No real signs of oxidation, infection, or souring despite being 11 years old.\n\nVanilla, caramel, toffee, treacle, dark cherries, coffee, and tobacco in the palate entry. Medium, slightly medicinal (cough syrup) finish. Complex, but possibly a bit past its prime.\n\nSticky, medium-bodied mouthfeel with substantial but not excessive heat from the ABV. \n\nMore than the sum of its parts, this is still one of the biggest stouts available, although, consequently, it's a bit sweet/hot.Feb 12, 2020"", '4.75This is probably one of the best sweet stouts I have ever had.

But ultimately it's closer to a cola/dark syrup/dark chestnut brown than it is a molasses black. Not much head at all: nothing more than a drifting of bubbles around the edge. No lacing to speak of. \n\nNose brings less alcohol heat than I'd feared. Sweet bourbon vanilla and oak. Some caramel. Honestly just not as strong as I'd expected overall. More pleasant and mellow and sweet. \n\nFlavour again belies the behemoth that lurks in these waters. 19.2% on the label, but I could be convinced of significantly less than that. Maybe not half, but closer to that than actuality. While I do get some heat, especially as I work my way through the glass, the prominent flavours are more the rest of the barrel, much like the nose. Vanilla, oak, caramel, maybe a hint of sweet sweet chocolate, maybe riesen-like toffee... This is decadent and rich without really being luxuriant. \n\nSmoothe and while it's thin (unsurprising given the alcohol and that), it is not conspicuously so. Again, this is a masterclass in taking an overbearing characteristic and folding it in to subtly be simply a presence. That may sound like damning with faint praise, but I absolutely do not mean it as such.

On the backend there is definitely a sharp anise / black licorice flavor that helps counter some of that sweetness.

Everything in it is subservient to the cacao-- the vanilla stands in for sugar, the coffee offers bitterness where the malty stout would itself refuse to. It does really remind you of a milkshake, but not quite because of any desserty cloying sweetness. It\'s the viscosity, the half-and-half mouthfeel that delivers the vanilla and cacao while somehow sneaking in a full 12 or 13 percent ABV when you can barely even register the burn. Mine poured into a snifter with no head and barely even the sound of fizziness, and on the nose it\'s pure dessert-- chocolate milk or devil\'s food cake. I try not to inhale too much as I drink it, because I want to catch the ancho chili and the beer in a way that the aroma doesn\'t carry. Usually, this is not my kind of thing-- I don\'t like foreign flavors as a dominant element, and I like for a fine food to carry more layers, or maybe more variance between its layers. ""Bomb!"", instead, wields its complexity in a way that focuses your attention onto that single 65-percent-cacao sensory simulacrum, making you wonder how this is even beer. \n\nI wanted to finish by saying that I respect this beer but didn\'t plan to buy another.

A hot peppery smell dominates and behind it, some roasted malt and chocolate. The color of this brew is the common black coffee and without any head, nor lacing, this looks like it could be a black coffee soda. But the taste is so much more complex and interesting. First, this is incredibly smooth for a laceless stout. It has a very good body, rich and velvety across the tongue. There's much to taste, mostly chocolate, somehow neither sweet, nor bitter, a hint of vanilla and just a little peppery heat. It's definitely not a burn, just a little heat. Actually, there's more pepper to the nose than to the taste. But that's OK. Why argue with a near perfect balance. Absolutely no clue that this rings in with an astonishing 13% ABV.

The flavor profile is perfectly balanced with no off-tasting notes. Cocoa nibs dance around with coffee and vanilla. Mild ancho chili spice rounds out the taste, keeping this interesting and preventing it from becoming cloying. This is on the sweeter side, and while there is a hint of roasted chocolate malt, it isn’t dry or smoky like some stouts. Highly potent at 13% abv, but the alcohol is masked.

Mmmm, it’s delicious!Jun 15, 2020', ""4.5*Poured into a Teku glass from a 12oz bottle*\n\nThe look of this beer was a very dark brown, reminiscent of cold brew coffee. This honestly didn't really have a head to it, so I can't really comment on the head, but there was a very thin dark drown lacing around my glass. \n\nThe aroma was heavy on the ancho chilies, which was super pungent upfront. It wasn't a one-note smell though, the ancho chillies served as a backbone for an overall savory, slightly sweet, and unique aroma supported by bitter coffee notes and a slight caramel sweetness from the roasted malts. The aroma almost reminded me a little of Korean red pepper paste, but I can also see people thinking this also smells a bit like soy sauce.\n\nThe taste more or less followed the aroma. The taste of the ancho chillies with a mellow coffee backbone permeated throughout the entire stout from start to finish. Although this beer primarily tasted of ancho chilies, I was also really able to taste most of the different flavorings added to this beer. Upfront, you get the taste of ancho chilies with a mellow coffee herbalness/bitterness that was complimented with a caramel sweetness. The sweet taste of the caramel seemingly disappeared towards the middle and end, which left me with the roasty taste of coffee that was also paired with notes of bitter dark chocolate and of course, ancho chillies. I couldn't necessarily taste the vanilla beans which was added to this, but I felt like it served to mellow and round out the other bolder ingredients which were added.\n\nThe feel on this was medium to full bodied, had little to no noticeable carbonation, and had a moderate lingering bitterness. All which contributed in making a silky smooth drinking experience. For the ABV, this was stupid drinkable and I felt like I had to keep reminding myself to slow it down and sip. That being said, I couldn't really taste the alcohol in this and there weren't any burning sensations.\n\nOverall, I have to say that this was definitely one of the more unique beers that I've ever had. The addition of ancho chillies worked pretty well when combined with coffee, cacao nibs, and vanilla beans, which I felt made this beer a satisfying explosion (no pun intended) of savoriness, sweetness, and roasty bitterness. Definitely good, and definitely worth the price tag.Jun 14, 2020"", '4.5Poured from a bottle -dark as night with little to no head or lacing.

Breakfast Stout,Stout - Oatmeal,Founders Brewing Company,8.3,4.55,"['5I bought this one on a whim. I love stoats, especially spiced, coffee, and chocolate one, so i figured I’d give this one a try. I was so pleasantly surprised. This is truly one of the best beers I’ve ever had. And, it has a decent alcohol content as well. I like it when a single beer is enough to relax me. This one tastes like dessert. DEFINITELY TRY IT!Aug 15, 2021', '4.5Look: Dark liquid, like black coffee.

A head barely forms before disappearing to the edges creating a ring of light cream that lasted until around half way through the drink. The edge thins to create a dark umber ring as I tip the glass back for a drink. \n\nThe stout smells mainly of coffee and dark chocolate with slight hints of caramel and malt. The taste is supremely balanced which is why this beer is highly rated. Immediately the coffee and chocolate hit on the front. I was anticipating a bitter or alcohol taste (due to the higher than average alcohol content) when the flavor moved back but that never happened. The coffee, roast, and chocolate continued all the way through and left a slightly spiced aftertaste.\n\nThe stout feels medium thickness but not creamy due to its low carbonation. Swooshing the the beer in my mouth it does have a creamier feel as the little amount of carbonation in the beer comes out. \n\nOverall, this beer is packed with flavor and has nearly no negatives as long as one enjoys coffee and chocolate! The only thing that could potentially be better is a creamy head, but that may mess up the balance Founders has struck with this gem.Aug 01, 2021', ""4.512oz bottle fill date of 3/11/21 into a large snifter.\nL: Pours very deep dark brown with a light ruby cast at it's outer edges.

There is a bit of mild oat sweetness that I get on the nose, but not on the tongue. The chocolate is a bit more pronounced in the taste. There is a particular roasted quality in the aftertaste that I like. It's a cup of joe that makes you feel even better. It's very smooth, which may be attributed to the addition of oatmeal (I'm just reading BA's description of the style at this point).

The flavor follows suit but you can distinguish the chocolate initially and the coffee on the backend. I like this beer but it’s not as complex as some of the other Founders which some may appreciate but I for one enjoy the mirage of flavors. Not a bad beer, just simple. Maybe if I had tried this before I tried so many of the other breakfast stout variants, I would have a different opinion.Apr 24, 2021', ""4.75Previously consumed and often, this review will be perfunctory. It's undeniably one of the best in the world. Out from the 12 ounce bottle into a clear Imperial pint glass, it's a richly deep and dark brown with a modest tan head. The roasted malt, chocolate and oat aroma can't be surpassed by any in this style. It just might be the smoothest and richest brew you can find. The taste overall is complexly bittersweet. There's so much good going on, but the prominent flavors are roasted, not burnt nor overly roasted barley malt, then coffee, then chocolate. If that's not enough for the taste buds to discern, there's some sort of mild spiciness created by the infusion of the major contributors. An amazing mouthfeel for such an ABV, this may be the world's best stout.Apr 10, 2021"", ""4.5Bottled 1'21, consumed 4'21. Poured into a tulip glass (cuz i like those).

Just the echo of sweetness. Hops are perfect - you couldn't enjoy this with too little and you couldn't experience the choco-coffee with too much. Perfect balance. Zero booziness for a heavy ABV beer.\nLook: cross between motor oil & espresso, but not as thick as the stuff left in the coffee pot for 3-4 hours.\nOverall: Has to be one of my faves for cool weather beers.

I would categorize it as a light barleywine that has sickening sweetness which the brew designers attempt to balance out by a gag reflexing characterless bitterness, resulting in an aftertaste of sucking on a bar of soap. The best thing it has going for it is a high alcohol content, but the problem is, that its so hard to choke down that its hard to drink enough of it to get buzzed before you give up and just go get a much more palatable high gravity malt liquor.

Massive malt presence. Reminds me of a sweet, mature single malt scotch. Specifically Oban or Dalwhinnie. Not nearly as much hop character as I expected from a brewery like Lagunitas. Under-hopping was a wise choice here. Bittering this up would take away from its drinkability, and remove the attention from the sweetness, which is clearly the star of the show. No hop bitterness at all. Not an IPA. The hops are there, and they provide a beautiful bouquet of springtime fruity, floral notes, like a flower garden, and orchard blossoms, with the faintest hint of citrus, lavender, bergamot, spruce tips, cedar, and fresh cut grass. Finishes sweet, malty, floral, with lots of vanilla, honey, caramel, and just the slightest little hoppy twinge, and a hint of booze. Spectacular.\n\nMouthfeel/Body: This ale is just a beast. A soft gentle giant. The body is thick, slightly viscous, incredibly chewy, round, and full. Chewy is the word. So much texture and fullness. Sticky, dense, nand heavy. Incredibly full-bodied. A little bit of warmth from the 10% ABV. Big ales like this will always have low levels of effervescence, as the bubbles just can't fight their way through the density of the liquid, but this is a tiny bit more bubbly than I expected, which works wonders in lifting the body up a little, and increasing the drinkability a little - although this is one you want to sip and savour.\n\nOverall: I'm disappointed in myself for not trying this sooner. This is a homerun if I've ever seen one. It's deliciously sweet and decadent, with an astonishing level of complexity that melds aspects of several different styles together. There's a little bit of scotch ale, old English ale, Amber ale, pale ale, and even some characteristics that are usually achieved via barrel aging - all blended together, with a commendable restraint on the level of hops used, by a brewery known for their heavy-handed hopping. This is a phenomenal dessert sipper, with remarkable balance, complexity, drinkability, and satisfaction. A unqiue and truly world-class American strong ale that I would even dare say rivals Founder's BA Curmudgeon's Better Half, and at a fraction of the cost. Amazing stuff.

In this case, it puffed up to form just under three fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, tawny head with excellent retention. Until it suddenly exhaled and fell like a soufflé when the oven door is banged shut, that is. Wow! In its wake was some of the densest, stickiest lacing that I have seen in a while. I am going to get Sam to clean this up as it may require a jackhammer to remove & I blame him for it. Color was Amber to Deep Amber/Light Copper (SRM = > 9, < 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose held notes of caramel, vanilla, oak, pineapple & hemp line/rope. 8=O We used hemp line as mooring line on some ships & going into the line locker, it had this kind of woody, resinous smell, but also ropy. Mouthfeel was big, thick & full, like a dollop had been scooped onto my tongue! I let it roll around like a playful puppy, really allowing the flavors to build to a crescendo. The oaky woodiness was prevalent, but the caramel & vanilla flavors acted as a nice counterpart with a warming sensation from the alcohol. Tasty? You\'d better believe it! Dangerously so, in fact, since it was going down like water. NOT recommended! Yowza. I also tasted a pine/hemp resinousness that I had not gotten on the nose, but at the same time, I did not taste the pineapple that I smelled. Very interesting! Finish was actually cool and bracing, like a shot of peppermint schnapps. That is imprecise. The taste was minty, but not pepperminty. More towards evergreen. Very clean, dry, literally breath-taking. It was like being in a stand of evergreens as snow falls all around and just taking a deep breath. Get the sensation? Whew. My only bugaboo was its extreme drinkability. I almost feel like taking a nap after this.

Really smooth with moderate carbonation. Somewhat drier on the finish.\n\nCBS is a beer that is remarkably good, but I think that these days it does not get the credit or accolades that it once did in large part due to what I think its is greatest ""virtue"" - balance.

Bourbon is the first thing that comes through in the taste, but the chocolate and maple notes interplay, with just the subtlest hint of the coffee. The mouthfeel is heavy, settling well on the palate to allow for an extended taste of each sip as the flavors dance in the mouth, with the warmth from the high ABV complementing the flavors perfectly - it's not too heavily carbonated either, which is great, since this is one you'll want to savor each sip of.

The first pour from my 64 oz growler produces a short-lived, off white head that left some lacing. There is no streaming of carbonation from the bottom of the glass, but the beer is not flat. The smell is subdued when at refrigerator coldness, and a caramel malt base dominates. Resiny hop aromas build as the beer warms and the taste follows suit with a toasty malt flavor that is dried by resinous hops. The mouthfeel is medium and the finish leaves a low level pine like bitterness on the palate. There are some citrus and floral hop notes too, but they don’t rise to the forefront. I’m sure this beer is different fresh out of the bottle vs. out of a keg, then to a growler, then to the fridge and eventually to my glass.

I suppose drinking this easy-to-find ale (released 19 years ago) gives away my bias: that I venture a lot less into the IPAs than most.\n\nThis also suggests I've been missing something. Drinking Centennial also gives me cause to speculate another theory about something I appreciate in moderation: that single hope ales like Centennial are both difficult for the brewer and the drinker. For the brewer, too many single hop brews require them to blend the malts better to meet the narrow range of what a single hop does. (So to keep it simple, the brewer blends the hops to meet the requirements of the malts.) On the other end, drinkers don't get the variety of sensations of multiple hops -- yanking our buds from sweet to bitter -- and, instead, have to work with our buds to appreciate a narrower range of differentiation. \n\nAll that said for a purpose... Centennial achieves what too few single hop brews achieve: it gives a variety of sensation from one hop, the Centennial. That, at least, is my theory.

Quite a nice beer, but doesn't really stand out among the pack. \n\nvery sticky mouthfeel, stickiness increases as the beer warms.\n\nOverall, not a bad beer, but not as good as I had hopedDec 09, 2020"", '4look: the best part, orange brown\n\nsmell: mineral pine\n\ntaste: mango, pine, caramel, a bit of bread malt but really not much\n\nfeel: a bit syrupy\n\n', '4.5Deep amber appearance with a touch of cloudiness, an average size off white head and good lacing. Hops in the forefront of the aroma while some sweeter malts lurk in the background.

Medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel leading to a long lasting finish. Well deserved kudos for its standard bearing qualifications.Nov 20, 2020', '4Expectations are high, let’s dig in, what’s in this 12 Fl.oz. can?\n\nTop: forms a 1.5” cream head, slow retention.

Some citrus and a hint of pines in the background. Medium+ carbonation, medium body, lasting, dry finish.\n\nSummary: a decent IPA, reminds me of Lagunitas (as in hop profile and smell) but this one is executed way better. I expected more details, to be honest. As I read in an other review, a 15 pack is only 15$, and for that price, it’d be a crazy good deal. Unfortunately in Ireland it’s 2.50€, and to me it’s not interesting enough for this price. The competition in this price range is brutal, and puts this IPA into the “good, good, but nothing special” category.Oct 29, 2020', '4.25Revisiting an old favorite due to my love of Centennial hops and needing a fix due to an abundance of Oktoberfests during the last 6-8 weeks. Poured from a can ""canned on 08.04.20"", so not as fresh as I would like. Still, this pour is a beautiful clear amber continuously bubbling a thin light lacing. Smell is piney, pungent hoppiness. Taste follows with just a tad of harsh grassy age flavor. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style. This beer is refreshing in the warm weather and warming in the cold. 15 packs at $15.00 is an added bonus.Oct 21, 2020', ""4Medium tan with reddish tinged 3F head settles to nice floppy foam topping after a slow descent.

The hops are light and offer a tang to complement the malt. The beer finishes lightly bitter in a black coffee kind of way. Reminds me a lot of Deschutes Fresh Squeezed but with less sweet malt and no real citrus notes. Subsequent tasting reveals a more pronounced piney resin that is not so agreeable.\n\nMouthfeel is medium body and carbonation. Nice clean tang on the roof of the mouth and light bitterness make this enjoyably balanced and just right for me.

Really nice IPA and now in my personal top 5 IPAs.Oct 12, 2020"", ""4.5Poured from a bottle at 45 degrees into a pint glass,\n\nLook: Pours a dark bronze, opaque color that is yet bright and vibrant.. Good to moderate amount of foamy head that lingers. SRM of 14+ (4.50)\n\nAroma: The aroma is heavy and resiny of dank citrus rainforest floor. Strong resinous blueberry and blackberry. Citrus, nectarine, ripe pineapple/grapefruit, and melon. Honey and wet piney, sweet grapefruit. Some stonefruit. A bit of rubber fishing lure. Also some wet herbs, onion, and slightly bitter cardboard atop some caramel malts. (4.25)\n\nFlavor: Flavors of dank citrus nectar and blueberry. Citrus, nectarine, and berry initially. Mostly tangerine, nectar, apricot, & melon/berry. I even get some chocolate behind that (possibly from the blueberry). Mild tea. A decent bitterness evolves, but it is followed by strong caramel and candied berry that predominates. It is aided by a wet cardboard and dry herbal staleness. Not off-putting tough. A delicious toasted cocoa and berry malts underneath--appropriate for a northern Michigan winter. Sweeter than I would expect, but pleasantly so. (4.50)\n\nFeel: This beer drinks syrupy like motor oil, but in a good way. The mouthfeel is heavy, absolutely delicious. Not sessionable by any means. The beer is well carbonated but heavy, creamy, and oily for an IPA. This hides the alcohol well. (4.25)\n\nCompared side by side to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA: This one has a slightly more heavy candied tropical flavors than citrus. Slightly darker color and heavier bodied. More resinous. More dark tangerine fruit and tropical flavor but is equally enveloped by the hoppy, bitter finish. Nearly indistinguishable. \n\nCompared to Sierra Nevada's 2019 Celebration Ale 3/25/20: Nearly identical in appearance. Stronger aromas. More tropical, nectarine flavors with a larger caramel body. Less pine and citrus. Heavier and sweeter, but more similar than I would have thought.\n\nCompared to Two Hearted IPA 5/14/20: Pours a darker color. Similar aromas, but slightly more malty and less fruity. \nCompared to Two Hearted IPA 8/28/20: Pours a darker color. Very similar aromas but slightly less zesty. Slightly more resinous, maybe more stonefruit and less chocolate. Slightly more bready. But man these are difficult to differentiate. \n1/25/21: Similar aromas. Milder. More earthy orange and berry. Less grapefruit, peach, and caramelized pineapple. More cocoa too. Earthier and more malty. \n\nCompared to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA 6/28/20: Pours a slightly darker color. Stronger and sweeter aromas of apricot, chocolate, and earthy resin. \n\nCompared to Jai Alai 9/20/20: Pours darker color. More resinous and sweet stonefruit, chocolate, and less citrus, orange, tangerine, juice. More pale pine and cardboard here too at the expense of less juice. Similar bitterness/sweetness profile. Both are pretty sweet. Winner: Hard to call.\n11/25/20: More caramel, cocoa, resinous orange and stonefruit aroma. Less tangerine and juiciness. A stronger bitterness overall.\n\nCompared to Deschutes' Fresh Squeezed IPA 2/15/21: Similar color. More earthy caramel, spice, pine, and dark sweet berry. \n\nCompared to Walnut River's High Beam IPA 3/8/21: Darker color. Maltier aroma. More earthy, dank berry flavor. Less orange juice and mango. Heavier and sweeter. \n\nOverall: This is an excellent heavy-handed American IPA. Strong, heavy, and flavorful. Maybe the Tripel of IPAs. It tastes imperial without being imperial Dank and resiny. Sweeter on the back-end, with strong berry and some toasted (maybe cocoa?) malts. Malt sweetness is definitely appreciable. A little cardboard characteristic, but it's actually pretty good. Slightly less bitterness than I would expect, but drinks perfectly smooth & creamy. Its a heavy creamy, darker, oily, and danker IPA with tropical and stonefruit flavors. One of the best. (Final Rating: 4.42)Sep 21, 2020"", '4.5This is an interesting ipa. There is a heavy malt-backbone, similar to what one would expect from a strong ale. It might have been too sweet if not for the hop presence, with a distinctive dry-hopped piney bitterness, which balances the beer.

The smell had roasted cocoa tones with light coffee comes through as well. The taste had a nice bitterness from the coffee combined nicely with the cocoa. I really like the aftertaste as it has a decent bitter cocoa/coffee combination coating my taste buds and has a lingering dry finish. On the palate, it sits about a medium in body that tries to have a decent sessionable aspect but it seems like I’m tending to sip this more. Carbonation is fairly smooth and is good for the style and for me.

Coors Light,Lager - Light,Coors Brewing Company (Molson-Coors),4.2,1.99,"[""1.5My first experience of Coors Light (Or Just Coors) here in Australia (as it's classified as full strength being 4.2% ABV), was several years back when Coca Cola first started importing it. Some friends and I had just finished watching a football (soccer) game at Belmore Oval, and we went back to the Belmore Hotel to have a few post-game beverages. Turns out the pub were running a promotion, something like a bucket of Coors (4 bottles) for like $15. Needless to say, being Uni students at the time, and also free pool, we took to it like a Pitbull at a postie. The little I remember of that night, I remember the bar tender telling me they'd be convinced by Coke to order way too much of this beer, and run a promotion on it, assuring the owners of the pub that it would sell like hotcakes. Apparently they'd barely made a dent in their stock, with the locals sticking to local adjunct lagers. My mates and I basically cleared them out of their Coors stock - which I think they were grateful for. Now, I don't remember if I liked it, but we certainly drank plenty of it given how cheap it was. \n\nLook: Very light, straw golden. Thin foam head that has disappeared instantaneously. Looks pretty average to be honest. Looks like carbonated apple juice. \n\nSmell: Wet grass, vegetable aroma, corn husk, some grain that reminds me of porridge. malt sweetness. Smells like a typical adjunct lager beer. \n\nTaste: Grains, slight floral flavour, sparkling water with a bit of beer in it. Honestly tastes like a mineral water shady. Hard to pick up any major flavour notes. \n\nFeel: Watery, carbonated, Would be mistaken for a flavoured mineral/soda water. I suppose it would be refreshing when it's hot and the beer is ice cold, but so can a glass of water, or cold mineral water. \n\nOverall: I hate reviewing beers negatively. But I only do so when there's absoloutely nothing I put a positive spin on. Sure, it's Refreshing when it's ice cold, but why waste the calories on a flavourless beer? If you're looking to get tanked, I mean sure, you can knock these back one after another, until you're inebriated, but why knock back 20 of these when a decent flavoured beer will do the same? \n\nDunno, I suppose there's a place for it, but my fridge unfortunately isn't it.

Curieux,Tripel,Allagash Brewing Company,10.2,4.31,"['4.252014 bottle, courtesy of my friend Jason. Poured into a Duvel tulip. \n\nL: Crystal clear medium amber body. The head is two fingers of fine white foam that leaves ample lace and replenishes itself with a swirl. Attractive. \n\nS: Very complex, with some vintage qualities (sherry especially) alongside the core components I remember from drinking this regularly on draft a decade or more ago: banana, apple, coconut, vanilla, and white pepper. Any actual bourbon aroma has long since faded, but the sweet accompaniments remain. Very nice. \n\nT: Opens with some bready malt ahead of the complex layers of fruitiness - banana and apple are joined by a strong melon note - followed by a touch of spice ahead of a rather boozy, dry finish. Lots of ethanol on the swallow, sadly overshadowing the great flavors that started things off. Not unexpected or particularly blameworthy in an 11% pale beer, but out of balance with the rest of the profile. \n\nF: Medium-bodied and full of soft, velvety effervescence. Perfect for the style. \n\nO: I love everything about this beer except its booziness, which I recall being the one thing I disliked about it back in the day. Even seven years conditioning in the bottle hasn’t fully tamed it, but it’s certainly held up admirably. I knew it wasn’t fresh when I opened it, but was shocked at just how old it was.

I sort of cringed at the idea of a bourbon barrel aged tripel at first, but Allagash came through and delivered on this one. I love my whiskey, but I\'m not really much of a ""bourbon barrel aged"" beer type of guy. I find that a lot of breweries don\'t get it right, and often the end product becomes either a hot boozy mess or a complete sugar bomb.

It's rich, sweet, smooth and malty. But that's not all. Molasses and hops bring an earthiness that, without being bitter, enhance what would make a good ale, like a Wee Heavy Scottish Ale.

Balance goes slightly toward the bitter end, but fairly well balanced. Light tonic water finish encourages the next sip.\n\nMouthfeel: Gritty, medium carbonation, fairly dry finish.\n\nOverall: A fine pale ale. I've wanted to try this for a long time given the high scores this has gotten over the years. I can see this being a local favorite, but it's a Pale Ale. A hard style to get super excited about, but would be very happy if it was a regular offering down the street. It's just not exponentially better than a lot of other Pale ales I've had. Put it in a lineup and I'd have a hard time picking it out.Feb 06, 2021"", ""3.5Lightly sour at at first with a light bitter finish. The floral nose to it was its most distinguishing characteristic.

I've seen this in 4-packs for $10.99 at my local grocery store.\n\nLook: Slight chill haze, beer seems to be gaining clarity as it warms from my super cold fridge. Light amber / golden orange color, looks very nice and appealing. Half-inch eggshell-colored head that slowly dissipates and clings a quarter-inch high to the rim of my Spiegelau tulip glass.\n\nSmell: Very nice, complex aroma. Immediately, I pick up on what I perceive to be cascade hops. There are probably a lot of other C-hops in here; the nose is quite floral and inviting. Surprisingly tropical nose with notes of mango and papaya. Also a definitely grassy element that borders on earthy, almost stinky soil that is not at all off-putting because it works well with the dankness. The nose finishes strong pine, resin, and citrus including grapefruit rind. Biscuity/crackery background note.\n\nTaste: Up front, the taste follows the nose but seems simpler and not as complex as the nose. Very dry, moderately bitter and slightly spicy finish. Very mild malt presence. Refreshing. A crusher! As it warmed up, more of the aromatic citrus notes came through on the finish.\n\nFeel: Light to medium mouthfeel, appropriate level of carbonation. Works well for a 5.2% American Pale Ale.\n\nOverall: Nice beer at a decent price that is crushable and refreshing. Excellent to drink on a hot day or with food. Surprisingly, IMHO the best aspect of the beer is its nose. I'm honestly not sure if this beer deserves all the hype that it gets, but it certainly does not let you down. It's been around for 10+ years and is not really considered novel anymore, and it has definitely stood the test of time. I look forward to trying this beer again when it is a bit fresher. Nice to see that it is so available here in PA nowadays.Jul 31, 2020"", ""4L: pours copper and clear, not a ton of head retention nor did I get much lacing\nS: mostly pine on the nose with a bit of citrus in the background\nT: taste follows suit with the aroma, get more mango on the finish.

Initial impression is a somewhat thin IPA with muted notes of lemon and a touch of caramel. Mouthfeel is just barely on the thin side of medium; carbonation is adequate but not dominant. Finish is clean and dry.\nMaybe I'm jaded by super-juicy, super-sticky, and occasionally super-sweet DIPAs, but Daisy Cutter just didn't cut it for me.Jun 11, 2020"", '4.25Pint can - dated 04/15/20 - Poured into an IPA glass at 38°F. \n\nHUGE thanks to Nick for this seriously longtime want - back when my beer wants were simple and obtainable.\n\nPours a pretty clear deep amber hue, with just a touch of unfiltered haze - topped with nearly three fingers of bone-white head with excellent retention. Substantial rings of lacing are deposited as the head slowly recedes. Plenty of visible streaming effervescence. Very handsome. \n\nNose: Wow, this is for real. Straight away, this is a malt-forward aroma. Serious notes of toasty caramel malt. The hop profile is also very traditional. These aren\'t modern varietals - this is mostly, if not all C-hops. I\'m getting huge notes of Centennial. Boiled, resinous C-hops lending big floral, piney, citrus peel notes. Lots of grapefruit. This is very much like Bell\'s Two Hearted on the nose. Very potent, but very classic. Very nice. Note: After it opens up, a dank (not musty/earthy Simcoe dank, but weedy DANK) mango note shows up, along with a whisper of smoked driftwood - of all things. \n\nPalate: Not much of a surprise, the flavour follows the nose well. The aroma is big, aggressive, and could easily be the aroma of a big, malty, hoppy imperial IPA, but this pale ale actually drinks like a pale ale. Restrained toasty caramel malt, restrained hops, and fluid drinkability. It greets the palate with grapefruit peel, tangerine, and lemon. There\'s actually a juicy acidity here too. Not like a fruity NE beer, but there\'s some zip to the citrus notes. The malt is toasty, grainy, bready, and a touch biscuity. It isn\'t sweet, and it doesn\'t outshine the hops. Towards the finish, the classic floral and pine notes come in, lending magnolia, lilac, lavender, gardenia, and some dank, woodsy pine. Surprisingly no bitterness, but it does finish with some nice drying resin and pith notes. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: This definitely feels like an APA. It\'s light to medium-light in body - never watery (thanks to that crystal malt), but crisp, snappy, fluid and bright. Zero stickiness, zero cloy, great effervescence, and dries out nicely. \n\nOverall: I\'ve wanted to try this beer for ages. Not for any particular reason - I just really wanted to try it. It\'s an OG craft beer ""want"" of mine. Now, it\'s nothing like I imagined, but it\'s an awesome American pale. I love that they went classic on this, and kept it traditional. The malt base is just perfect - supportive, but remains highly refreshing, the hops are very unique - classic, but with some interesting notes, and as a whole, the beer is flavorful, satisfying, refreshing, crisp, interesting, and relatively low ABV, which is great. What can I say? It\'s a damn good APA!Jun 05, 2020', '4.25Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Captain Lawrence, muffin top pint glass; canned 03/26/20 with code IT WAS ONLY CANS!\nA: Pours a slightly hazy, ?somewhat birefringent, dark golden color with a one to two finger, rather short-live, white head, rim retention, and broad, somewhat spotty lacing.\nS: Aromas of caramel, lemon, toffee, light pine, and unrefined grains. \nT: Fairly dry.

I live in Canada so I can only seem to find it whenever I’m around Chicagoland for work and it’s really spoiled me for Pale Ales back-home, because there is nothing like it here. \n\nHalf Acre calls it a “Dank” Pale Ale and that’s exactly what it is. It’s got a real unique hop bitterness to it that smacks your palette and doesn’t let you forget it. There are a ton of floral and pine notes here for a Pale Ale with a respectable finish of fruit just when you think it’s too bitter. If you like a hop bouquet on the bitter side of things check out this beer, as it’s got a standalone, complex bitterness. It’s almost like when you were a kid and your friends dared you to eat a dandelion, but it’s what you were hoping the dandelion taste liked. The name is really fitting in this sense though, there is a real bitter, floral twang going on. \n\nSmall reduction for the really thin foam that is created upon pour, but outside of that it’s a unique and special Pale Ale.Apr 11, 2020', ""4.5LOOKS: A pretty clear 24k gold to light amber.

So, I think Dale’s Pale Ale qualifies as historical, in the short history of American IPA’s. In spite of that I have never tried it until now. I was reading about the history of craft brewing and IPA’s and Dale’s Pale Ale features prominently in some of the articles. Made me curious. Then, to my delight, my local bottle shop had it in stock! (they probably have stocked it since 2002) So I grabbed a six pack and headed home. Could not wait to try it, open one right away and, yeah, I see what all the fuss was about and why this beer has lasted. If you haven’t had one you should. If you are a fan of IPA’s you owe it to yourself to experience this bit of history.Jul 02, 2020']",6,18,6,27,16,9,0,9,41,2,6

The bottle shop had this labeled as a Russian Imperial Stout. You stout drinkers can imagine my disappointment. \nIt is not that this beer is bad. Looks, smells, tastes and feels like a Belgian. Not a particularly good one so I’m surprised by the ratings. It’s spicy banana Belgian blah blah boredom all day long. Almost as if someone said, “let’s brew a prototypical Belgian.” And strong ale? At 7.5%? I have had abbey ales at 10%+ with heavy duty sediments and incredibly complex flavors. Those are Belgian strong ales. Duvel, though decidedly weaker than some, is light years beyond this. The temerity!Jul 25, 2021', ""4.5Inspired by Duvel in style, Damnation exudes the Sonoma terroir: winey, yet wonderfully dry.\nThe yeast reminds me of Belgium's passionate pints, particularly how the yeast works up the malts. And a dash of pepper. Spritzy.\n\nBecause Russian River produces mostly world-class Wilds (and I shy from the style), I am glad to see their excellence applied to the BSPA. Preceded by two Bay Area cheeses, Damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and Italian parsley.May 24, 2021"", '4Uncaged and uncorked this pour produces an exceptional foamy white head on top of an opaque dirty lemon yellow body.

Flavor profile is resiny, herbal, grassy hops that reside at the back of the tongue after the malts finish singing the chorus. Malts are biscuity, wafery, crackery and pale. A little lemon grass and clove lingers towards the finish. Mouth feel has a bubbly effervescent that somehow expands and fizzes on the tongue as it hits, growing the texture from start to swallow. Crispness creeps on towards the finish, after the initial foamy expansion on the tongue. Overall, bubbly and yet crisp with a refreshing display of malts and hops behind.

Consumed January 2014. ""Bang on for the style."" 3.88/5Jan 26, 2020', '4.5I got one of these expensive bottles of World-Class beer from Whole Foods for $7 each. Poured into a stemless wine glass because I don\'t have a tulip or goblet, the recommended glassware for this style. \n\nLook: The golden color of the body is reminiscent of unfiltered Buckwheat honey, an orange-hued amber. Super fluffy, frothy, choppy, and billowing slightly off-white head. The body is hazy and shows ample carbonation from the bottle fermentation. When the cork is popped, the bottle oozes smoke like some Harry Potter shit. The lacing drags down the glass like foamy bunting. \n\nSmell: Right after popping the cork, I immediately get an incredibly complex aroma of toasted challah, fig, a touch of orange zest, phenolic clove, banana, delicate white pepper, and caramel. This stuff smells mouthwateringly good.\n\nTaste/Mouthfeel: The incredibly rich bready taste has mounds of caramel, toasted challah bread, browned butter, light hop spice, earthy hops, biscuit, and sophisticated yeast-derived banana and fig flavors intertwined throughout the perfectly balanced yet still malt dominant flavor profile. The flavors explode across the palate as this liquid genius glides down the throat. The hopping perfectly balances and complements the other flavors, yielding pure earthy and slightly spicy mild bitterness to back things up. The body is overall a solid medium; hearty with enjoyable chewiness. The well-hidden alcohol is slightly warming as the beer comes up in temp, with a reassuring kiss of sultry euphoria that caresses the mind and spirit. \n\nOverall: Incredible this beer is outstanding evidence of just how good Russian River Valley is. I loved digging my nose into the soft, smooth foam of the aromatic head and gulping down the cool liquid genius. Incredibly smooth and drinkable, with such deliciousness that each richly pleasurable drink makes you go ""mmm"" and smack your lips. This is one of the best breweries in the world. This beer is extremely delicious in every way. A fantastic example of the style, one of the best beers I have ever had.Jan 16, 2020', '4.5The beer pours with much froth with a slight stinging sensation when tasted.

When I opened the cage, the cork popped itself out about 5 seconds later like champagne. Smell features belgian yeast, black pepper, grass, hay, fruit esters, grains, spices and citrus zest.

Feel has the grains and yeast qualities to it, but elevates with the airy carbonation and the dryness.Sep 30, 2019', '4An impatient beer, I removed the cage & it ejected the cork. It couldn’t wait to be poured. A partial pour resulted in a glass full of the fluffiest foam ever. Using the side of the glass & a gentle pour I was able to transfer Damnation to my glass.

Excellent feel. . I look forward to Damnation.Sep 28, 2019', '4.5Massive, thick head with a golden marmalade look. The smell is really amazing, is sweet acidic fruit and yeasty.

Time to go proper with this classic...\n\nAfter the 20 or so minutes of patiently pouring this beer, what\'s left is a magnificent sight. A rather ""normal"" yellow/orange glow with less than perfect clarity is topped by a massive, monstrous foam. Rocky is an understatement, and really just the beginning. Smooth, styrofoam looking iridescent bubbles form into pinnacles making a snowy capped mountain range which doesn\'t budge even with the sway of the glass, just like a DQ Blizzard doesn\'t submit to the laws of gravity when turned upside down. Finally, it recedes leaving a crater of liquid surrounded by walls of froth plastered to every square centimeter.\n\nAt just a few months old, the aroma is still quite pleasant. Pepper and herbal wildflowers, like a classic Saison are met by the clove spice and subtle sweet fig, or fig like fruitiness, jamminess of a Belgian ale. A touch if banana comes through as it gives in to ambient surroundings.\n\nThe flavor, however, lacks. Quite a bit actually. A dusty old white pepper grinding, rather spicy, and dried grass or hay flavored for the most part.\n\nLight, and exceptionally dry and bitter. Leaves a dirty feel on the lips. Again, this is extra spicy.\n\nNo question about it, this is not the Damnation I remember from 10-15 years ago. Still a decent beer, but once the excitement of the appearance died down this just lacked from then on. This is severely missing a sweet element that I swore it once had. All well. Still love you and always will, Russian River.\n\nCheers.May 02, 2019', ""4Very clear deep yellow brew - very active on foam with a thick head - great retention.

Super excited i found it. I like the mystique surrounding this beer. Only available once a year. Only available at the brewery in Indiana. Rated super highly. Many derivative versions that are also rated highly, if not higher and single bottles that trade for hundreds of dollars in private circles on the internet. The multicolored waxes that adorn each year's vintage. The black wax that adorns mine. It's my son's birthday, so that seems like a good occasion to drink it. \n\nPoured out a heavy dark brown, nearly black, with a creamy one inch head that dissipates into a ring around the glass. Scents of dark raisins and other fruits, a bit of vanilla. The smell isn't very strong, rather on the weak side so i had to swirl my glass several times to release the aromas. Upon sipping, I'm greeted by raisin and rich sweet chocolate, and a bit of cherry. Perhaps a chocolate covered cherry. Notes of char and leather are present. Coffee is used in this brew but it's not too strong. The brew is mostly a sweet wash, with just a little bit of bitterness to balance it, hovering on the back end as it washes down my throat. Dark Lord is thick and syrupy, just the way I love my stouts, and sticks to my lips, sweetening them long after the swallow. Overall this is a beer to enjoy as a meal in and of itself, as it is hearty and rich, bold and strong at 15%ABV. \n\nI've read that this stout was there before stouts really came into their own, and that the overall field has risen to meet the standards this beer once set. It's better than some stouts, like i like it better than Old Rasputin, but in fact it is comparable in overall savory flavor to some Hoppin Frog stouts like TORIS. So while once upon a time some may have journeyed far and wide to experience this flavor, i think one can obtain beer just as good as this without searching too far from home. However, what an experience! And I feel like I've now joined a secret club. The Dark Lord club.Mar 27, 2021"", '4.25Bottle, 2009 vintage, kindly shared by gunnar. Black colour, hardly any head.

A swirl forms a dark brown collar and some cling along the glass. \n\nNose: Big, bold roast lends some baker\'s chocolate, cacao, burned toffee, brown sugar, and a deep, almost savoury character. Yes, I understand where the ""soy sauce"" descriptor comes from. A bit of a meaty character, with some char and marmite, but this seems to be a product of the heavy roast. Some underlying dried cherry dark fruit. Definitely unique. \n\nPalate: Before I start, I will say that the savoury soy sauce note is strictly limited to the aroma. It doesn\'t show up here. Moving on. A few things stand out first. One, this stout is sweet. Very sweet. That unique concentrated cane flavour of the Indian sugar is present, along with the sweetness. Lots of sweet, tarry molasses, brown sugar, and even a blackstrap rum thing going on. The vanilla is definitely lending character, but not like a ""vanilla stout"" - it\'s tame, identifiable, and well-balanced. I\'m not getting any coffee. The malt itself is so classically Russian, with big, super dark roast, earthy char, and all those bold roasty notes. The hops are also very old school, with earthy, leafy bittering hop character meshing with the roast. Approaching the finish, vanilla fades, and the blackened roast and earthy hops take over, pushing some sweetness out, lending some earthiness and char, but very little bitterness. The finish highlights this, with a touch of molasses. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: While it didn\'t appear so on the pour, wow is this one fudgy. Full-bodied, heavy, thick, and chewy, while not crossing the line into syrup territory. It isn\'t close to BBT or Assassin thick, but it\'s certainly in that same vein of luscious and fudgy. There\'s actually some nice, fizzy, albeit fine effervescence that pokes through a bit. Definitely some residual stickiness. \n\nOverall: This is an interesting stout. Today, we\'re inundated with all of these mega pastry stouts brewed with half a bakery. While there are ""adjuncts"" in here - vanilla, coffee, and Indian sugar, those flavours are dialed way back, to the point of almost feeling like a plain stout. It\'s the sweetness that really stands out. On top of that, it\'s the only dessert stout I\'ve had that retains that classic Russian Imperial flavour profile, and that\'s unique. Picture a dessert Russian Imperial Stout. If that sounds good, then this will likely deliver.Feb 18, 2021', '4.25Very solid Russian Imperial.

Really searching for that coffee and might not taste it at all if I didn't know in advance it was in there. Vanilla/brown sugar really the pre-eminent taste, though with some restraint. Malty, not much evidence of high ABV heat. All in all feels very muted as far as a world-class stout goes.\n\nF: Full bodied, little to no carbonation. Well-balanced, especially with control of ABV on the back end as you only get a tiny bit of heat at 15%, and that is impressive. Sweetness similarly is well-controlled, as this easily could get cloying, but falls short of that. The ABV certainly helps in that regard. But there's just not enough taste and I don't think any amount of aging will make that better since it already is well-melded and pretty drinkable.\n\nO: Big 3 Floyds fan and this new one definitely runs laps around the disappointing 2015 I traded for a few years ago (can't account for someone else's storage).

Flavor profile is caramel, toffee, molasses and chocolate in a thick, syrupy bite that comes across just shy of being a dessert. Toasty, roasty and caramely malts add a little depth, along with a kiss of char towards the finish. It's dynamic, but balanced, easily transitioning between flavors.

Well worth the hype. And yet a little different from the other heavy imperial and Russian imperial stouts that I’ve had in the past.

Found this one online and tried to wait until a milestone beer - #900 - which was not easy. Pours a deep, dark, rich black opaque color with a little film of tan head and very spotty lingering lacing - it had to be a vigorous pour though. Smells incredible, dark rich roast coffee, caramel, dark stone fruit, brown sugar, malt, molasses, maybe a hint of bourbon. Just a hint though, definitely not like the BBA stouts. Taste follows the nose, incredibly well balanced and rich and complex. Seems like the darker fruit comprised of cherry and raisin, not cloyingly sweet although definitely a touch of sweetness in the foreground. Nice warming alcohol throughout, definitely a sipper but no burn at all. Stronger notes as the beer warmed. Excellent mouthfeel - syrupy and chewy, decadent, rich, smooth, coated the palate.

As it warms, it gets a bit boozy.\n\nMore promising in the flavor department than in the nose. Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol ""heat"" is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there\'s a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used.\n\nMedium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel. \n\nThis is a beast!

Start off only decent, pours a honeyed medium amber color with a little white head that quickly settled to a thin film. Also just a little scarce spotty lingering lacing. Even with a rocky pour, the fluffy white head had settled quickly. The aromas, however, were just incredible. Beautiful fruity hops of mango, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, passionfruit, guava and lemon. Also some nice malt, floral and herbal hops, bread, caramel and a little dankness. Taste follows the nose, very rich and flavorful with good balance. The strong hit of hoppy bitterness was well offset by the sweeter malt backbone that had a good presence. Mouthfeel was excellent, sticky, slightly luscious, smooth and coated the palate. Good amount of carbonation. This was definitely a sipper, the higher ABV was quite present even with the beer cold, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I’m happy that Founders brought this one out of retirement to serve it on tap at their brewery.Sep 26, 2019', '4Look: Oooooh. Almost brown-orange.

Layers of lace cling to the glass with each sip. Juicy pine, grapefruit, and resin highlight a well rounded aroma profile. Bold but not too aggressive, almost a savory hop profile. It's juicy up front, grapefruit and resinous in the middle and then it finishes with a zesty pine. There is a an aggressiveness to the finish and a lingering boldly hoppy aftertaste. The body stays on the lighter side, somehow making for an almost refreshing sip and making this as dangerously drinkable as it is sipable. Really good selection from Victory here.Dec 27, 2020"", '5Dank Dank Dank. Piney and very hoppy but it defines the term dank, and in a good way. Drink this one by itself.

Nicely balanced, plenty of hop flavor, little bitterness.\n\nTaste: Hop bitterness right away, gliding the palate, stays calm and cool. Modicum of sweetness strokes the tongue, bumps up against bitterness, and the slide together down the throat. Malt body is medium-ish, light, not getting in the way of the hops. Alcohol isn\'t felt, but hinted at. Oh, wait, there it is…\n\nDirt Wolf isn\'t a pretty name, but I assume it has links to the lore of hops. Before I check the label to see for sure, I will add my final thoughts. This is right on the money, delicious, balanced double IPA that perfectly fits the mold set by Bell\'s HopSlam. It\'s a good formula that\'s proven popular. And easy to market: ""Can\'t find any HopSlam? Think HopSlam\'s too expensive? Try this, it\'s just as good!""

Taste follows the nose, with a caramel, biscuity malt backbone and some toffee, chocolate and red berries, complemented by hoppy notes of citrus and pine. This really is an Imperial Arrogant Bastard, which really piles on the malt, without losing much of the hops. Depth of flavor seems more intense compared to normal AB, especially when it comes to the malt presence and fruitiness. Hop profile seems a little more mellow, although there still is considerate piney bitterness (this may be due to the 26 months old bottle). The higher ABV is noticeable as a slight, warming presence, but there really is no unpleasant boozyness to this at all. What really needs to be highlighted compared to normal AB is the thick, smooth mouthfeel, which is absolutely sublime.\n\nHaving a 2016 (3+ years old) bottle of this right now, which I'm not enjoying at all, this is not the same beer I remember, with the bitter, resinous hops almost completely gone and overshadowed by an intense sweetness and solvent-like character in the aftertaste, which may be due to oxidation. I've heard people say that this ages beautifully, which may be the case if you're into Barleywines, which this has basically turned into, but I couldn't finish the bottle.

There's a big nose, a combination of sweet caramel and hops. The taste is complex, but hops and bitterness dominate the taste. It's just slightly sweet in the taste, enough to make it interesting, but not enough to compete with the bitterness. The ABV is not particularly noticeable, but that might be because the hops are strong enough that who has time to notice the ABV?\n\nThis beer is about midway between a classic hoppy barleywine and a conventional strong ale. What I mean is that a strong ale is something you can drink, while a barleywine is usually just a sipper.

Even with all the alcohol aroma and flavor there is little ""heat"" detectable at the finish. Overall this beer lacks the hop character expected, but that is most likely due to the age of the bottle.

I also get some fresh tangerines and just cut grapefruit.\n\nThe malt is masked by the hops but a nice sweetness peeks through. It’s a very light caramel which again would probably be a sledgehammer with most beers but here barely provides balance.\n\nTaste – The hops here are gigantic. As in the nose, it is the fresh non-resiny pine that leads the way. It is so smooth and so big I had to do a double-take. The orange provides fluidity and a nice citrus contrast. The malt comes on bigger at the taste so although not an even balance by any means it keeps this from tasting cheap.\n\nMouthfeel – Huge for the style, this is nearly full-bodied with a giant bone dryness that isn’t offense due to the sweetness of the orange and malt.

The expected bitterness is almost entirely absent till the end of the sip. The bourbon and chocolate are VERY strong. You get hints of this or that with other good stouts but Dragon's Milk's taste hits hard. The bourbon hits first and is what made me sit up straight and think about what I was tasting. The chocolate is the undertone there, and I'd jump at the chance to buy a bar of chocolate that tasted like this. It's not even a dark chocolate taste. This is grade-A milk chocolate. The extent of the first burst of flavor is surprising for a beer of any kind. After that, the bourbon flavor lingers over notes of vanilla. It makes you want to savor every sip. \n\nFeel: Smooth and creamy at first, and then it sparkles for a second right at the end of the sip. You feel the carbonation, but it doesn't feel very hoppy. The carbonated sting does not last long at all. This isn't as thick as some stouts, which would usually be a downside for me, but it works well here. It doesn't miss out on smoothness. \n\nLook: Super dark. The head is creamy and doesn't rise too much on even a careless pour. (I experimented a bit.) \n\nSmell: Maybe this beer's weakest point. You can smell what's coming if you know what to look for, but it doesn't catch on the air and draw your attention. It's like she knows she doesn't have to try. \n\nBetween the taste, the smooth but sparkling feel and the 11% ABV, this is a sipping beer. There are lots of higher priced stouts less worthy of being savored. This is a treat-yourself-beer and an admirable flagship. \n\nAs I said, I decided this was my favorite beer after one sip. And I promise that's saying something with how much I favor my local beers. This isn't local to me, and that hardly made me hesitate at all to put it at number one.

The Bourbon barrels show the highest class and quality, reminds me of the smoothness of a highlands scotch like my favorite 21 year old Macallan -- but instead of with the finest Cubans this Ale provides all the richness and flavor of a full meal and I delight in the expression of flavor on my palate, not the full fillet mignon, lobster and potatoes of the best Belgian Ales but Dragon's Milk delivers to me more of the 2nd half of that meal along with a sweet delicious chocolate desert. I'll leave the subtle details of taste, character and aftertaste to all the other reviews but with a brew/stout that tastes this good all I can say is -- wow! Thank you New Holland Brewing for bringing such a warm and wonderful brew to my holiday and into my home. This will always be on my list and I hope I'll always have on reserve. And I thought Michigan was known for cars -- one day I'd like to sail from Chicago to Holland just to taste and enjoy your wonderful Ale made on The Lake (Lake Michigan.) My first review, next will be Black Ops Stout, with these two the best brews available during this winter holiday time of the year. Should mention for an occasional stand by whiskey, I love a good bourbon such as the Tennessee charcoal filtered Jack Daniels.

I like to think I\'m normal (even tho I deep-down doubt I am.) But there is always something unknown about 3 Floyds, like some unspoken family oddness. While we all got that, I suspect 3 Floyds is telling the truth and truly is not normal. What does this have to do with beer? I dunno.

In addition to aromas of wood I’m picking up notable fruit esters. In particular, I can smell ripe cherries and other ripe, pitted fruit. Interestingly, I can also smell notes of vanilla. Subtle as it is, vanilla coupled with aromas of wood keep the fruit aromas from dominating or overpowering. And yet, the fruit esters have enough tartness to prevent the nose from being overly sweet.\nTaking a sip, Duchesse de Bourgogne is smooth and enjoys up front flavors of tart ripe fruit. Fruit flavors taste like a combination of ripe, dark red cherries combined with supporting flavors of lemonade. This is all supported and by flavors of wood and vanilla, helping to smooth out the beer’s overall tartness.

There is a small amount of sediment at to bottom of the glass. \nThis style is something I don’t enjoy often but this is a fine example. I would recommend this beer to anyone looking to branch out stylistically or to anyone who enjoys this style but hasn’t tried this version. \nLuscious, well rounded and true to style, this would pair well with a charcuterie board.

The aroma is superb.. a roasted, carmelized nuttiness outshines the sweet chocolatey notes, but the most exceptional scent is a smokey, salty, atmosperic freshness that oddly enough, smells like you are on a large, fresh water lake or coastal river.. earthy, but not oceanic. The head dissipates but remains strong enough to lace the glass nicely all the way down as you proceed. Although the mouthfeel is slightly thin, the taste is subtle, complex, yet refreshingly clean. The chocolate and coffee notes are forefront, but that smokey malty salted breeze is still in the mix.. this is a killer porter! There may be another American Porter or two better than this, but it seems unlikely while you are drinking one of these. One of my long term, go-to, everyday drinker all-time faves! It seems even more relevant now that I have moved onto a Michigan Island in the Great Lakes system, and can look at Canada across the Detroit River.

I wonder if this beer will have dank characters. This my second Stone beer within the last week. Time for the review. \n\nThe beer is 44 degrees and served in a pint glass. When I opened up the can, an immense dank aroma emitted. The head created in the glass from the pour is a two-fingers thick. The color of the beer is bright white.

The beer has a bright hop profile. The hops in the beer are harmonious. The malt is firm and holds up well. The beer does have a malty sweetness from the malts. This beer is packing a wallop with a high ABV. I thought that the malts were sweet, thus an indication of alcohol. It was a run of the mill type IPA, nothing special.

As it warms, more floral notes become evident as well as the citrusy flavor of orange peel. The floral nature has an amazing and unique note of lavender that I have never experienced in a beer before. The medium body finishes clean and dry, with support from the ample carbonation giving an overall impression of lightness. It's quite rich but with the scrub from the bitterness and the carbonation working together excellent drinkability is achieved. The alcohol is well-hidden as well.

Pretty standard in terms of big bold flavor, however I felt the bitterness was a bit too prevalent as this stout warmed. It would have been a bit more agreeable if was slightly sweeter.

This is up their with your Mikkellers, Deschutes, Avery, Founders, New Holland, Oskar Blues, & Firestone Walkers of the beer world. Due to the oak aging that coffee is going to last longer than usual which is a good thing if your sitting on a bottle that is somewhere between 6 months to 1 year old. The 6 pack of highland black mocha stout that me & friend drank was blown out of the water by this beast. This blows the others from the oak aged lineup out of the water as far as I'm concerned.

Spot on with the espresso notes. I\'m a huge espresso fan so this hits home for me. GD nails it in the espresso department. Dark chocolate, almost bittersweet cocoa, falls in just after the espresso. This is a palate banger, for sure. The chocolate adds an under note of nuanced sweetness and backbone. It just keeps all the bold coffee and chocolate in from running rampant. As the beer warms, the beer softens up, as does the coffee/espresso notes. I pulled and poured this beer (tulip) at about 48F and let warm. The hops are present also. Notes of herbs, modest hoppy spiciness, along with a hint of minty ""greeness""/freshness. Body is slightly creamy and carbonation is sudsy and welcoming. Big ash/acrid notes and black licorice-like spices linger on the palate. Overall, this is a very good beer. If you\'re not the breakfast stout type, walk away. If you are a fan this will be on the extreme edge of the sub-style. For me personally, it\'s a bit much on the coffee and roasted flavors. If it had just a little more pronounced sweetness, I would love it. That said, I like it. It\'s well crafted. I have friends who love beers like this. If you can find bottles I would suggest trying at least once. I will sit on my second bottle for a year or so and see how it mellows.May 22, 2017', ""4Growler into pint glass.

The roast bitterness has diminished into an ashy charcoal flavor. The molasses, on the other hand, only seems to have been strengthened with age, becoming the primary player in the game dark chocolate is still a competitor, as is (what I can only describe as) aged coffee, which holds just enough bitterness to balance the rather prominent coffee acidity, and the overall impression is a lightly carbonated Irish coffee with invisible cream that someone left out all day. \n\nAs ridiculous as that sounds, it's actually really smooth, with a creamy onset and a dry charcoal finish.

Rather transparent with lowly visible carbonation beyond the fluffy head.\n\nS: Caramelized sweet malt and hints of corn. Maple Syrup background, like sweet dark cornbread. Hints of fermented yellow apple.\n\nT: Malt forward that develops tangier over time. It begins as baked brown sugar, than gives way to a bit of hops, washed away by barley and caramel. A fruity zing at the end of apple/cherry.\n\nF: Light and easy drinking. Medium carbonated and a ,medium-light body. Fan-friendly and not satiating.\n\nRight away, I thought the taste of corn would turn me away, but I ended up quite impressed. The balance of sweet malt pulled away from the tang of fruit and slight hop presence, creating a subdued party in my mouth. Well-rounded and unassuming.Jan 17, 2021', '4.5This beer is a classic!

Very drinkable with a slightly dry finish. \n\nOverall: This timeless beer is refreshing and full of character. It is a go-to for any time of day, and pairs well with a wide array of foods.

Like many other red ales, unless we're talking Nugget Nectar, you don't get an overwhelming scent of anything more than sweet malt. Appearance-wise it reminds me of Yuengling but a bit more golden and light. Head takes minutes to proof. \n\nThe mouthfeel is a medium-bodied flavor with mild carbonation alongside the aforementioned sweet malt character that is easy to finish. The sweetness lingers on throughout this one and is a bit sorghum like. I am midway through and have tried to allow the beer to warm up, it is watery and sweet with a bit of forgettable flavor. This happened to me in the beginning of the year when I tried this beer again. Allowing the beer to warm up I get a very basic malt structure, the sweetness is still very much there, but it reminds me more of a märzen than an 'ale'. Not too sure how ale is 5.2 abv.

Not too sure if something changed but I remembered this beer being like a brown sugar beer and today it is just sweet waterish malt.Dec 27, 2020"", ""3.75Good looking glass - bright, clear golden leaning towards amber color with a low and persistent head of foam that left some pocked trails.\nAroma is German lager-like with floral and herbal notes supported by faint sweetness.\nFlavor is Amber-lite - a great intro beer for noobies who maybe don't like hops. \nThere is a nice light grainy character that makes it kinda interesting but it lacks body or malt complexity. \nThe mild hop rate is just enough to lend some balance to the watery caramel malt sweet. \nThere is more going on here as it warms a bit, hinting at what this could be if not thinned out for mass appeal. \nFinish is sudden, slightly dry with a soft caramel sweetness that is not unremarkable. \nThis is better than expected and I've had a lot worse.Nov 30, 2020"", '4.5Amber ales are my favorites and this is a really great one.

Average to limited lacing.\n- Clean. Malty with clear notes of soft peach and a suggestion of acidity.\n- Clean. Tart, balanced by sweetish grainy malt and then livened by soft peach. Very little bitterness but still with a dry, mildly acidic finish.\n- Light body leaning towards medium-light with a gently effervescent and bristling bite due at least in part to the acidity.\n\nSo to the ""overall"". Unlike many Berliner-weisse-style beers this one is very clean. There are no off-flavors and not too much mineral qualities or anything like that. And unlike many breweries that add fruit to them there\'s just a light pleasant note of the peach here that adds to the beer rather than it being a fruit beer that happens to have a Berliner Weiss base. It\'s easy to drink despite its tartness, and quite refreshing. It doesn\'t linger for long, and certainly isn\'t sticky, and it\'s perfect for summer. Very nice.

Aroma is a bit yeasty. Fruity aroma is not too potent to my nose, but there's some lemon and passionfruit juice. Flavor is a completely different level, with pineapple and tropical punch blasting through a bitter, hoppy backdrop which is unmistakably an IPA. Where this beer really excels is that it is both a juicy NE IPA and an American IPA at the same time, compromising on neither.\n\nI'm tasting this side by side with the more famous Heady Topper, which I recall not liking quite as much when I first tasted them side by side in, I believe, 2017.

But the combination of flavors and balance of Focal Banger is just so much more impressive to my palate that it will always be the better beer in my opinion.

Reminds me of west-coast aromas but with some dark and tea undertones. Some blueberry and red grape. Strong dank and earthy pine give a pinecone characteristic. A caramely malt backbone with some dank fruit of blueberry, cherry, and maybe apricot. (4.25)\n\nFlavor: A perfume & citrus hits right upfront. Orange, grapefruit, nectarine melon. Floral and tea-like. Has a caramel water quality that is similar to Sierra Nevada and turns carmelized. Decent amount of the dank pine, earthy pinecones, and black tea quality. Strong notes of the dank Simcoe, but there's definitely more complexity. A spicy caramel and toasty malt backbone that surprisingly gets eaten up by heavy-hitting bitterness on the finish. The spicy caramel was light and overall and finishes with an icing of pinecone bitterness alongside the spicy caramel malt structure of the beer. (4.50)\n\nFeel: Lighter-bodied. Well-carbonated.

It's also dryer and more bitter with a stronger pithy and pine bitterness. More black tea. Slightly more west coast flavor. Similar bodied and carbonated. It finishes more bitter and has less of a honey malt sweetness. \n\nCompared with Todd the Axe Man: This one pours much darker. It has more pine but less citrus. Its more bitter than fruity. More pine and black tea. Darker malts, but less malt body and finishes bitter and dry. \n\nCompared to Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA 5/7/20: Pours a darker amber color. Stronger aromas.

Less caramel and dark malts. \n\nOverall: A complex beer! So much going on here. Red grapefruit, spice, caramel and pine-cones. The delicious citrus & caramelized fruit are only a fraction of what this beer delivers. Tons of Simcoe flavor, but with a very west-coast flavor profile too. It has that dried fall leaf and nectarine fruitiness that lingers. Lighter bodied while maintaining the bitterness. Overall, and outstanding beer. Perfect for a Minnesota winter, but it really has to be fresh to get the impact of this one because it drops off quickly with age. Find it fresh and it's worth it.

Malty and spicy (is there rye in here?), balanced evenly with citrus (grapefruit), mild tropical fruit notes, pine. Substantial finish. The astringent bitterness of the hops and the creamy sweetness of the malt (I'm getting toffee now and even a hint of something almost sugary) pair so well here. This really doesn't taste Furious at all, nor even mildly annoyed. This beer clearly had a good outcome from anger management training because it is remarkably smooth and composed. In no way a hop bomb. Satisfying hop flavor and bitterness but it is met with a really rich malt bill such that neither takes the center stage.\n\nLuscious soft velvety mouthfeel.

The head blooms up pretty well. 2 fingers that stick around for a decent length of time. Color is fantastic. Almost like a barrel aged rosé. Light copper color probably best describes it. Aroma is nuanced but not complex. Grapefruit notes give way to caramel. Neither overly sharp or pronounced, but not muted either. Understated but enjoyable smell overall. Taste leads with a quick flash of subdued caramel bready flavor, then develops into a kind of navel orange taste, then to grapefruit rind that defines the finishing bitterness on the back of the palate. Bitterness lingers but isn't over powering. Invites the taster back for more.\n\nOverall, I love this beer. Wouldn't call it crushable by any means. Probably one 16 oz can would be my limit. The hop bitterness can become pronounced as you continue drinking. The best thing about this beer is the value. 11 dollars for a cold 4 pack of 16 oz cans in Minnesota. Can't beat the quality and convenience at that price if you want a cold one.Aug 20, 2020"", '4Pours a hazy copperish amber color with a pretty decent sized khaki head. Leaves some gross ""lovestains"" around the glass as it settles into a ring.\n\nThe aroma is surprisingly malt-forward; like caramel bread. Does that exist? It does now. There\'s some faint grapefruit and orange but the caramel notes dominate. I wish caramel would dominate me. Anyway.\n\nThe citrus notes come out of the closet in the flavor: Grapefruit and fresh tangerines with a hint of orange zest. The caramel is very much present and adds a solidly sweet note between the citrusy beginning and earthy, dank, piney finish.\n\nFeel is medium in body with crisp carbonation. Lingering bitterness, like an old war veteran. Nicely crushable.\n\nOverall, I like it. It\'s a well made West Coast (or Midwest) style IPA. A 4-pack was $12.75 so yeah I\'d buy this again.Aug 02, 2020', '4.5This is one of those ""constantly loved by everyone on BA but I just assumed it would always be impossible for me to get"" beers, an illustrious subset of brews including those by Bell\'s, Old Nation, Weldwerks, Aslin, etc. Somehow, the stars aligned, though, which led to a local Craft Beer Cellar location getting in a fairly-sizable drop of both Furious and Todd the Axe Man. Though I\'m not a big fan of the latter (have reviewed it before and was, honestly, quite let down), this is just awesome and I\'m extremely excited to finally have it in my glass!\n\nAlright, so, I\'ve obviously heard a lot about this beer. And right away I will say I prefer the old can art with the amusing Surly logo on it, but what\'re you gonna do? This is a beautiful beer, though, anyway. It\'s actually more of a ""red IPA"" by modern standards, anyway, with a medium-dark amber color topped off with a fluffy, voluminous head that leaves behind some soapy, indeterminate lacing. The retention here is excellent and the surface coverage is nearly-unparalleled in its density. The body of the beer is clear as can be, which gives the deep color an even more satisfying look to it.\n\nThe nose here is an old-school assault of floral, pine-y, sweet caramel, toffee, and intense citrus aspects, all vying for space and, unsurprisingly, being treated with a good amount of respect. I get a touch of earthy onion upfront, which is appreciable and works well with the dankness that runs as an undercurrent. Already reminding me of a smaller version of the original Oskar Blues G\'Knight, which is one of my all-time favorite ""sticky"" darker-red IPAs. It\'s more caramel-like than Nugget Nectar as well, in my opinion, but there\'s even more tangerine and orange rind with a touch of grapefruit here to balance the malt.\n\nFirst sips are clean and crisp, with a somewhat-sweet-leaning malty overtone melding with bitter citrus peel and earthy, floral notes coming out in the mid-palate. More bitterness in the finish, working well with the sweet Scottish malt to really coat the palate. Speaking of that, the feel here is just awesome! It\'s drinkable and complex at once, and, even though it\'s less than 7%, it has the flavor of a bigger beer. This is absolutely worth the hype, and the price was even fantastic ($12.75 a four pack of 16 oz cans, canned ten days ago... what the hell!?). This is definitely a new go-to if it finds its way around my area with greater frequency. Can\'t believe it\'s taken me this long to drink but it was worth the wait, indubitably!Jul 25, 2020', '4.5Wow. Brilliant. Had never seen this beer in my area.

Only a few scattered sections of lacing were left behind once I took my first few sips. Tons of floral notes, citrus pith, dry lime, and smooth hops could be found in the nose but the overall appeal was that of a dry and earthy beer. That\'s exactly what this turned out to be once I sipped this as it felt much stronger than a session IPA and I needed a chaser of water to fully get this down. Some prickly pear cactus and pine emerged as this warmed up but the basic malt presence and grassy aftertaste weren\'t enough to put this over the top.\n\nRegardless of the flavor profile, the lack of discernible alcohol made this somewhat easy to quaff and the slightly resinous aftertaste was a pleasant reminder that this was indeed an IPA and not a Pale Ale.

Taking a closer look reveals caramel supported by just a whiff of nuttiness. Flavors of malt come through here, giving me toasted grain and soda crackers. The finish reminds me of spicy, peppery European hops.\n\nOn the tongue, Goose Island IPA is smooth, crisp, and medium bodied in nature. Malt flavors dominate up front in the form of caramel, nuttiness, and freshly baked dark bread. The malt profile reminds me somewhat of the NEIPAs with deeper malt profiles. The finish is crisp, lasting, and assertively bitter which again reminds me pleasantly of a good English IPA.\n\nPersonally I find it refreshing when an American brewery honors an old world beer style like this rather than putting an American stamp on it.

Pass on this one.Friday at 09:55 PM', ""3.5Drank this beer all summer, having done so I'm not sure if I'll drink Guinness anytime soon. It's very 'Guinessy'. It's what you expect when looking at it: thick, creamy, coffee tasting, smooth. If beer had a desert, this would be it. But because it's so distinctive and after you have become accustomed with the taste, it's hard to envision you drinking the beer in any common setting you would normally drink beer. The plastic ball in the can is also not very flattering.Aug 31, 2021"", '4.25L- It is a very dark brown almost black stout that slowly forms a really nice looking light brown almost latte-like head made up of really small bubbles that gives the beer a creamy texture.

There are not much hops present in the taste but I detect a very faint hoppy bitter aftertaste.\n\nF- The beer itself is a bit watery but the head gives the beer a really nice creamy texture that I really enjoy so make sure you put a really nice thick head.\n\nO- Really good beer for being a commercial one. I would prefer the taste to be a little stronger, more malty like the bottled one but I really enjoy the texture and the casual taste it gives. I could drink 2 of these or more no problem by itself or with some food. I will definitely try this again when I can.Aug 21, 2021', '3.75Kind of overrated beer for me. Was really looking forward for a pint of this legendary beer in Ireland. Turns out it tastes a bit weaker than I would expect. Not great not terrible.

The go-to Irish Dry that can be found anywhere, and luckily its a pretty good stout!\n\nThis stout was from a 4 pack of nitro cans. Pours deep black into my traditional pint glass. At first pour, the beer is full of foams that coalesces upward into a 3/4in creamy head with bubbles so fine they are impossible to make out with the naked eye. The tan cream head floating on top of a black liquid can only be found elsewhere in a root beer float. As with a root beer float, this is certainly a treat.\n\nWhile having an impactful look, the smell is more subtle of malt, roasted grain, and a slight bitterness. I really don’t pick up the coffee or more nuanced smells that other reviewers get.\n\nThe taste of Guinness isn’t something novel or noteworthy. It has a simple palate of malt, roast, earthy minerals and maybe if you really look for it the bite of coffee without the traditional flavor of coffee. It is balanced, smooth and nonoffensive.\n\nThe feel is where the Irish Dry Stouts are absolutely loved by beer drinkers like me. To be such a dark color with a creamy head you’d think it would be thick and strong. However, an Irish Dry is remarkably cool, refreshing and disappears before going down making it a light feeling beer. Guinness has perfected this feeling with its heavy entry and light exit as if half the beer transported away somewhere between the tip of my tongue and the back of my mouth. It is a unique and refreshing feeling.\n\nOverall, a Guinness stout is the staple example of an Irish Dry Stout and is remarkable in its consistency, world-wide delivery quality, and provenance. While the flavors aren’t something to write home about, the holistic experience of the feel, look, smell, and taste make it a national treasure to Ireland and I can definitely see why. Guinness is my go-to Irish Dry. Although in Ireland, I did enjoy Beamish slightly more from the tap. However, here in the states, long live Guinness!Aug 01, 2021', '3.5Actually, my first Guinness ever. I’ve used it for cooking brats before (doing that now), but I’ve actually never tried one until now. I knew I liked it for cooking but have always heard very mixed reviews on it, so I’ve just stuck with styles and beers I know I like. Overall, I really dont see what all the fuss is about, positive or negative. It’s just not anything very special. It pours smooth, the color of cola, but a bit clearer. Not so clear you can see through the glass, but you can definitely tell it’s truly a dark brown, with a bit of a burgundy hue, not a black like I expected from it. Head is pretty small, only about one finger, if that, with a few rocky bubbles but mostly fine bubbles nestled in compactly with each other. Also not entirely what I’d expected. The smell is a bit faint. I can certainly smell some dark chocolate notes, and heavy malt, but nothing that really punches you in the face. I expected a smell that would immediately say “I’m a f***in Guinness!”. Just wasn’t there. Feels smooth going down, a little more roughly carbonated than I like in a stout, but still quite smooth. It tastes a bit earthy, with lots of coffee notes, and certainly a bit of chocolate on the finish, but overall, just not really “wowed” by it. It’s alright. I finish the extra one I bought and probably not have another one unless someone has it on hand at a dinner or bbq. It’s not a bad beer, but it’s not awesome either. Just somewhere in the middle. I’d say it’s mostly on point for a stout as far as texture and WHAT flavors you get off of it, but I vastly prefer a very strong stout to this. Again, really not sure why this beer seems to be so polarizing. Some LOVE it. Some HATE it.

Clearly the initial look was fabulous given the nitro widget. Thick, creamy tan head and the first couple sips were silky smooth given the nitro. And the dark malt bitters (not really hops) were a nice complement to the initial creamy feel. Unfortunately it falls apart after a good opening. There was little lacing and the head collapses to a thin white veneer. While there was no tinny aftertaste (I'm pointing at you Boddingtons), the flavor profile descended to something like slightly bitter dark water ... not unpleasant but not a lot there. Maybe the solution is to knock one back in 5 mins and move on to the next beer?Jun 02, 2021"", ""3.75Guinness Draught pours into my glass deep, sullen, ruby red in color, just verging on pitch black. The head is dense, mousse like, and coffee cream in color. The head is lasting.\n\nUp front aromas give me something minerally in nature. It's somewhere in between naturally occurring chalk formations and smelling the ocean itself. Hints of roasted coffee lend immediate support before moving into what smells like a combination of caramel and nuttiness. Everything combines to give Guinness' nose a slightly leathered quality before moving on to a short, cropped finish.\n\nOn the tongue, Guinness is full, smooth, and luscious. Mineral flavors up front remind me somehow of the sea before moving into very subtle hints of roasted dark grain. Hints of caramel provide a pleasant, but not overpowering sweetness. There's also that little bit of nuttiness helping Guinness keep its overall structure. Flavors finish off with a nice little hit of roasted coffee before fading into the night.\n\nGuinness is full, rich, and smooth. It's pleasant and balanced in its own right.

Much more lively than a regular Guinness. Big frothy tanned head, black is the colour. When settled its not bad on the eye. Good lacing remains on glass. \n\nOn the nose I get the typical Guinness aroma, stouty and peaty, chocolate and caramel. Actually I would go as far to say it is even more “peaty” than the regular Guinness. Does smell authentic, roasted barley, grainy, malty and smoked peat. Nice smell, with a lot of character…..\n\nOnto the taste, well first off it has the expected Guinness feel in the mouth, very typical of the famous stout. Get the roasted barley and malts, the coffee and chocolate flavours, But there is more to it than that, there definitely is a nod to the old style with this brew, feels more porter in the taste, and the flavours are more to the fore, thanks to a higher ratio of hops than the regular Guinness. \n\nGreat to drink, has a real character to it, and I love the coffee flavours swirling around in the mouth, brilliant stuff. \n\nWhen I bought a few of these cans, my sister immediately laughed saying I bought into the gimmick. It’s not like Guinness to bring out a million different versions of essentially the same thing, their famous draught stout. She thought it was a slightly more “expensive version” of the same thing. To be fair I was half expecting that too! But no, I can state there is a CLEAR difference with this to the draught. It is softer on the palate, very well balanced, has more flavouring, is tastier, and one doesn’t get that bloated feeling you get when you drink a lot of the regular Guinness. \n\nLiked it a lot, very satisfying and easy to drink and I WILL return again for future inspection. Recommended. \n\nI have started to think maybe the regular Guinness isn’t in fact the master, the number one, perhaps the original, the Extra Stout, should be my go to Stout in the future…….oh dear, what a dilemma.

The dry finish accompanied by the hoppy nature of the finish makes this a pleasurable experience, I am guessing 18 IBU's? The signature malt roasting is intensely right in your face.

Hazelnut Brown Nectar,Brown Ale - English,Rogue Ales,5.6,4.09,"[""4.25Appearance - Pours an opaque saddle brown with a slight tint of dark amber and burnt orange when held to a light. Little head that disappeared immediately. No lacing left on glass.\n\nSmell - First aromas are chocolate-caramel candy. Noticeable maple syrup sweet smell. Slight nutty and toasted grain scent. No detectable hops.\n\nTaste - Molasses, deeply roasted grain, chocolate cookies are the prominent flavors. Faint nuttiness and herbal or grassy notes were detected. It wasn't nearly as sweet as the aromas led me to believe. While there is a mild sweetness, there is enough bitterness to perfectly balance things. The aftertaste is both sweet and bitter and thankfully it lingers for a while. While the hazelnut flavors are barely there, this brew is still delicious.\n\nMouthfeel - Body is full and it hangs on the tongue for a while. Visually, the carbonation level looked low but in the mouth its actually moderate. This brew finishes dry and clean. \n\nOverall - Disclaimer: Like an old man, brown ales are one of my favorite styles. I like malty, slightly sweet, full, dark toasty beer. This one hits the spot. The sweet/bitter ratio is right, it has some complexity (which many brown ales don't), and the after taste is terrific. This review is based off of my first sample of Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar.

Once my holy grail, now on to the next whale. I have drunk 1600 beers on BA and Reviewed 99%. As I look back since I began this journey, I am dumbfounded by how far I have come. My palate continues to improve; with every sip of beer, my beer knowledge grows, and my appreciation for the craft multiplies exponentially. The beer is 44 degrees, and I used my Jester King glass. The pour created a massive three-fingered bright white head with excellent retention. The foamy and soapy head dissipated slowly, tatting lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 5, pale straw with light golden hues. The clarity of the beer is somewhat hazy, with yeast floating in the liquid. The beer is sublime. \n\nThe aromas are oranges, passion fruit, pineapple, toasted cracker, biscuit, bready, floral esters, a touch of pine resin, earthiness, and the ever so slight hint of grapefruit. \n\nThe flavors in the beer are oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, pineapple, peaches, bready, biscuit, floral esters, a touch of malty sweetness, a skosh of pine resin, earthiness, and toasted crackers. \n\nThe mouthfeel is astringent and a touch dry. \n\nThe body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and long pleasant finish. \n\nI cannot find anything wrong with this; damn near perfect. I wanted the hype not to be true, alas it is. The harmony and the balance are like watching a perfectly time ballet. This beer is incredible, one of my most favorite beers to date.Aug 28, 2021', ""5I live in VT and buy a pack of these every couple months. Most recent was canned ten days before consumption, yesterday and tonight.\n\nAbout as good as beer gets, truthfully. Heady varies a bit year to year, but this year's have been excellent. Maybe it's just me, wanting a strong brew after a troubling times, maybe not.\n\nThick hoppy, dank, and catty flavors are almost overwhelming but ever so balanced by some magical blend of juicy citrus and malty notes. Some will say it's too bitter, but I find it smoother and more drinkable than most beers of this style. Many similar beers are too sweet, or astringent and unpleasant on the throat as they warm. Heady is exemplary because it can be smooth and almost refreshing while socking you on the chin with hops. \n\nI am biased - this beer has a place in my heart. I love to try new things, especially beer, and am lucky to live in a place where I can get lots of tasty drinks. That said, I keep coming back to The Alchemist. Not an everyday beer for me, but easily world class and a something you can feel good about buying.Aug 26, 2021"", ""4.75I know I'm supposed to drink it from the can... buuuut it pours a semi clear yellow orange color with a medium bodied white colored head that fades quickly but laces the glass nicely on the way down.

Pours slightly hazy and with a nice white head, though not quite as cloudy or murky as Focal Banger. Aroma is not the most potent, but it has a more traditional pine hop profile than I expected. Inhaling deeply I do get a bit of sweet juice. Flavor is big on those tropical juicy flavors. Guava, mango, grapefruit zest. Where Focal Banger has considerable IBUs and conventional alpha bitterness, Heady Topper has the strength and even a hint of the 8% ABV is actually present on the palate. But this is really only a comparative defect; compared to millions of other IPAs the alcohol is still very well hidden.\n\nTasting this side by side with Focal Banger I appreciate the differences but confirm my initial impression from 4 years ago in Burlington -- I prefer FB. Both have an excellent mouthfeel, with very fine carbonation, which by itself might be remarkable for an American IPA in a can. But this beer is quite literally heady -- and I'm not one to shy away from heavy beers in the 8-12% range or even higher. But the balance and flavors in Focal Banger are just better in my opinion, even better than this unarguably great beer.\n\nPotentially this is Heady Topper's 15,000th review??Jul 31, 2021"", ""4.5Appearance: Clear, light amber (unfiltered) with fluffy white head with good retention\n\nAroma: Layered with pine leading, then Citrus & Tropical with a trailing woody/musty (some call it dank) note.\n\nFlavor & Aftertaste: Alcohol is noticeable. Citrus & resinous pine prominent with spicy notes mixed in. Aggressive bitterness on a low to moderate sweet malt backbone.\n\nMouthfeel: Highly astringent with a lengthy dry finish. Bitterness builds and lingers well into the finish.\n\nOverall: Rated this versus other DIPA's. Thank you to BA advocate buddy for providing. I can see what the hype is all about. For fans of a DIPA, this one is top tier. Terrific layered aromas starting with pine, then citrus & tropical fruit ending with a note of woodiness/mustiness (dankness) as you work you way through it. It is aggressive bitter & astringent, so beware of that if you are adverse to those characteristics. The finish is dry and lengthy with the bitterness lingering well into the finish.Jul 16, 2021"", '5Other breweries that arent focusing on making pine the central-flavor of their IPAs aren’t doing it right. \n\nThis and MBC Dinner are THE IPAs to be drinking.

This is like a whole bunch of ingredients mashed up together, but in a good way so that nothing slaps you in the face as a single ingredient carrying most of the load. Yes, I did drink some from the can but no big difference from the flavor in the glass, and this one looks so nice it is a shame not to take in the visual pleasure.

This is the real deal - no froo froo additives or quadruple dry hopped monster, just sheer goodness in the way of The Alchemist and their double IPA. The look is raw honey, and the aroma a clearly Citra led hop parade. Very pleasant. The taste though, excellence in the NE IPA genre - just outstanding in flavor and feel. Apparently one is meant to drink this from the can and going forward I will, but for this round I wanted to see what I was drinking.\nAnyway, the more beers I am exposed to, the more I appreciate the basics, the ones that strive to be the best in category by pure skill and ingredients, not the latest hop or adjunct.

However, I properly rate this beer, I am going to have to make a compromise. Poured a little out for look and smell, drank the rest from the can. Translucent canary yellow beer. Lively looking with bubbles of carbonation rising up. Head a bright white and pours at a little less than a finger, but retains really well in a thin layer and leaves globs of lacing. Aroma is probably my least favorite part of this beer (but still great). I get citrus (mostly lemons), cane sugar sweetness, and some resiny hops.\n\nT&M: Spectacular and unique. Even with all the hazys on the market nowadays, this one still stands out. Even though the can clearly states that ""this beer is not intended to be the biggest or most bitter"", but it hits. Huge hop flavors! Most piney and resiny, but with more subdued notes of floral and citrus (grapefruit and some lemon). Slightly spicy towards the finish mostly black pepper and a little chili pepper. Bitter and dry finish. Not as ""juicy"" as other hazys, but it works well with this beer. To John\'s credit, I do think this beer is better consumed out of the can. I think it really does taste better. Fantastic mouthfeel. It is very crisp but combined with a medium body, this beer\'s texture is nearly perfect.\n\nOverall: Wow! I am so glad I had an opportunity to try this one. Definitely lived up to the hype! Belongs in my top 10, and it is the best Hazy IPA I have ever tried.

A very light yeast flavor is present which gives the beer a very light dough flavor. Towards the back of the mouth there is a light herbal flavor which tastes a bit like bay leaf, and at times a slightly astringent cedar wood.\n\nMouthfeel: It is medium-full bodied with a nice thick presence on the tongue.

Hints of ripe corn sweetness come out in the center. The finish gives a faint whiff of hops in the form of fresh cut grass.\n\nAt first blush, Heineken is smooth, crisp, and refreshing. Mouthfeel has a roundness I find pleasant in a good lager. Ripe, sweet corn combines with something that strikes me as a sort of bread or rice pudding sweetness. The finish dries out a little before leaving me wit just a hint of leafy, grassy hops.\n\nHeineken really is a decent enough lager in its own right.

It may have had a lot to do with the fact that it was something new, something I\'d never tried before, but it was also popular. I don\'t know. But it tastes a lot different now, a bit less than 2 weeks later.\n\nTruth be told, I don\'t really like Heineken. It still looks and feels fine, and I still enjoy the bubbles quite a bit. However, for a 5% abv lager with 142 calories, not only can I come up with a dozen better brews that I would enjoy more with around the same alcoholic content and less calories, but I also can\'t justify the price being around $1 per can. The main issue with it comes afterwards: the odd, unfitting sweetness that tops off each sip both at the very end and slightly after as an aftertaste. It reminds me way too much of Bud Light, which to me is close to undrinkable unless I\'m already drunk (or at a party).\n\nI do thoroughly believe the people who say that it\'s better in Holland though; heck, a somewhat close friend of mine is from a rural area in Germany and says Heineken is far and beyond one of the best beers he can get in his town. I think the big thing for me though, as much as certain brews might be better in their own home country than imported, I actually still enjoy a lot of them imported (Guinness is a good example). Heineken though, I can\'t say I like it all that much beyond the first maybe second and a half after pouring it into my mouth. It has a somewhat nice flavor at that point and is very bubbly, but the moment my tongue soaks it up and I begin to swallow is when it all goes downhill.\n\nI\'d love to try Heineken locally (or at least in Europe in general), but as far as it goes here in America, I\'m gonna be skipping the Heineken from now on.

Up front the beer has this slightly sweet malt flavor which transitions into a grainy taste at the end. The malt flavor is very good. Accompanying the malt is a bitter pine flavor which is fairly strong. It is important to note that while the beer boasts ""10.0% ALC. BY VOL."" on the label the alcohol is very well hidden.\n\nMouthfeel: It has bright carbonation and a sharp, strong bitterness. The beer has a medium body and although there is sediment visible in the glass it has a clean finish.\n\nOverall: It is a pretty standard Double IPA without any bells or whistles but that is what is enjoyable about the beer. It tastes the way one would expect a Double IPA to taste. One element that brings this beer out of the average rank and file of other Double IPA beers is the nice grain flavor in the finish. Another element that is noteworthy is the clean mouthfeel that delivers an exceptionally pointed bitterness. Although I wasn\'t a fan of the loads of sediment in the beer I would still drink it again and I would recommend it to others. Just ignore the sediment and let the flavor do all the talking.Jun 16, 2017', '3.75This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a semi-dark hazy brown color with a thin white semi-foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace.

The flavor takes the sweetness of the hops to the sweetness of the malts to enunciate a low riding overall sweetness. Light tobacco smooths into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a slidingly smooth sipping quality to it. Carbonation runs fairly light.

I certainly drank a lot of it back then, and then strangely I seem to have forgotten all about it. Well that\'s at least partially because that was 1995 and I couldn\'t get it back home. Anyway, it\'s poured a creamy finger-thick head of off-white for me atop a surprisingly hazy copper body. The aroma is brightly floral with some roses, fruity with apple and perhaps a hint of pear, and gently earthy and mineralish. It\'s very English in character, and I wonder why you don\'t see more beers like these lately. Moving on... the flavor follows the aroma as is usually the case, with some added lightly caramelish, grainy, and even honeyish malt and a bit of leafy and tea-like character from the hops. It\'s really nicely rounded with all of the components being clear enough that you can find them on their own, but also working with everything else to create a ""whole"". A median bitterness balances it (the label notes 30 IBUs) and it finishes mostly dry with some residual malt and plenty of floral, fruit, and softly mineralish notes lingering. The body is medium, and in keeping with the English character it\'s only softly carbonated giving it a smooth mouthfeel. Very nicely done. The only knock I have against it is that the head retention and lacing could be better but at the same time I\'m not sure if the glass I\'m using is actually ""beer clean"" so I\'ll have to give it a pass.

The rye definitely comes through on the nose, curbing the caramel sweetness, along with resinous and earthy hops. Nice balanced complexity. \n\nTaste: The sweet caramel is evident right away, and only becomes more prominent in the finish. It is balanced by the complex hop profile, which combines herbal earthiness wth a citrus element perhaps made more obvious by the sugary base. The rye creates an element of peppery spice that works well against the softer notes. \n\nMouthfeel: The strong hop and malt flavors are well supported by medium body and medium carbonation . The dryness is detectable only after the swallow, at which point the tongue begins to prickle.\n\nOverall: A tasty, well balanced beer which uses rye to bring a unique spicy kick to juxtapose the unusual sweetness.

There's a bitterness presence here, but outmasked by the honey/malt sweetness. \n\nFeel: Heavier bodied upfront. Only moderate carbonation. Hides the alcohol well within the malts. A rather dank and strong pine bitterness. Don't be fooled, it finishes heavy, sticky, and sweet, which isn't particularly pleasant. \n\nCompared to Hop Valley Cryo Stash IPA 4/29/21: Pours a darker color with a larger head. Milder aromas. Light to moderate aromas of resinous mandarin orange. More caramel malt, honey, dank berry, and pine. \n\nOverall: Not unlike my 2020 review, this one has a large malt body upfront, some mandarin orange and tropical, dank berry notes in the middle, before it's all cleaned off by a dank pine and strong honey/caramel sweetness. For some this beer is a reminder of home. Maybe a barleywine. For others, it's just an over-done IPA. If this beer was a pickup truck, it would be an F-150 excessively jacked up 8 feet with oversized tires. This beer can be made, not sure if it needs to be. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2020 Review:\nAppearance: Pours a completely clear, deep, orange color with a large, sticky, white head. SRM of 11-15. (4.00)\n\nAroma: Moderate aromas of tropical citrus, grapefruit, floral, and pineapple underneath a layer of honey. There's mandarin orange, grapefruit, pineapple, berry, but all masked by the honey sweetness. Lighter aromas than I expected. (3.50)\n\nFlavor: A wave of candied fruit flavor. First it's candied necatarine, citrus and pineapple. Some berry and tropical melon too, but not as much. Then a moderately strong bitter citrus comes through at the end to finish sweet, but relatively bitter. (3.75)\n\nFeel: Heavier bodied and sticky. Carbonation is no match for the sweetness. Actually hides the alcohol well though. Finishes heavy, sticky, and sweet. Not really resinous, but more honey-like and smooth. Leaves a sticky, cola type of sugar grittiness on the teeth. (3.50)\n\nOverall: Not sure how to rate this one. Obviously way stronger than an IPA should ever be. It's packed with fruit sweetness and stickiness which is offputting. The only positive thing about it is that it hides the alcohol well underneath that. No alcohol burn. But this beer is like drinking the nectar out of a birdfeeder. There's a little bit of fruit in that honey.

Some hints of tangerine, pineapple, and persimmon. \n\nPalate: Hopslam greets the palate with big sweet crystal malts and a bit of honey biscuit quality - bready, and just that classic, almost barleywine malt sweetness. Atop that, lots of West Coast leafy hop notes - dank Simcoe, tangerine, dried papaya, green leafy cones, candied citrus, and some classic spicy and herbal boiled hop notes. The finish is honey malt sweetness, malted barley, and by now, yhe hops begin to exhibit some sweet dried apricot, white grape, and some vaugue fruity bits, lacking any real pine or pith, but some resinous bitterness appears.\n\nMouthfeel/Body: This one's pretty full-bodied. Heavy, slick, and weighty. The effervescence is lower, but helps a bit, and the hops dry out a touch on the finish, but the sweetness lingers. Hint of stickiness left around the lips. \n\nOverall: Last year's batch was my first ever Hopslam, and it blew me away. For some reasons (HELP!) several of my reviews have completely vanished, including that one. Is this a good DIPA? Yeah, it's great. But from what I remember of the last batch, this is an entirely different beer. Less hops, more sweetness, and non of that beautiful character that made it so unique. Last one reminded me a lot of Pliny. This lacks that entirely. This drinks more like a weird alternate dimension Bigfoot.

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,Stout - American Imperial,Cigar City Brewing,10.2,4.62,"[""3.752018 Vintage\n\n750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want!\n\nPours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75\n\nNose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25\n\nPalate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0\n\nMouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25\n\nOverall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.\xa0 3.75Jul 09, 2021"", '3.75Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She\'s upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can\'t get this around here in Ohio, and I\'d heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I\'ve been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he\'s from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I\'m actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there\'s some Scoville units on this one, I can\'t detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I\'m not going to be that generous, as i don\'t think there\'s anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i\'m just sullied by my wife\'s remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i\'m drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40.

OK, it\'s poured an opaque black body beneath a finger-thick head of dense dark tan foam. The aroma is a little floral and perfume-like - I can see the almond in it but it comes across as extract (and to be honest, what else would it be?). I get some roastiness as well, I guess coming from the coffee, but I don\'t really see it as ""coffee"". Moving on to the flavor, there\'s more coffee to it, and more almond although it still has that kind of sweetish candy and perfume-like character to it. I like this but it\'s not reminding me of having an espresso and a biscotti at one of my favorite little hole-in-the-walls in Italy. Maybe it\'s a little like an espresso with a shot of almond syrup but that\'s even a stretch as it just doesn\'t have the intensity in the coffee side. Ahhh, I walked away for a bit and it\'s warmed some and now when I smell it I get coffee first and almond second, so that\'s a change. I like it better this way, I thought I\'d had it out of the fridge for long enough but I guess not. So, back to the flavor... I\'m still getting more almond upfront, and some vanilla, and then the coffee - and that\'s not bad. Is it knocking my socks off, no, but it\'s OK. It\'s a bit sweetish but I guess that\'s what we\'re going for here, right? Could it pass as a dessert beer? Yes, I guess, but I still feel like it\'s coming off as a little artificial. OK, where am I? Bitterness! Yes, it\'s got a moderate bitterness and it balances it but something lingers in my mouth that doesn\'t feel right - I\'m guessing it\'s extract although lactose can do this to me as well. I\'m not sure there\'s any lactose involved but who knows. In the mouth it\'s medium bodied and gently crisp and then smooth across the tongue. The alcohol doesn\'t come across at all unless it\'s adding to the perfume-like note. In the mouth it\'s medium bodied but dextrinous, and quite smooth. Overall it\'s an interesting strong dessert beer that\'s probably worth taking a look at.\nReview# 6,507Mar 07, 2019', '3.5Really enjoyed the look, smell, and flavor of this beer.

Seven years of meditation have mellowed out the scent, polishing away any malt bitterness or alcohol, leaving only the gentle smell of the woods. The flavor is lusciously smooth, with the lightest glaze of vanilla skating on a sheen of smooth restraint. It's boozy, yet it doesn't taste like it is.

I found the 2010 version on draft somewhere so this is very aged.Sep 20, 2017', '4I\'ve had several bottles of Stone\'s Imperial Russian Stout over the years, but those generally pre-date my ""serious"" days of beer criticism and enjoyment. So I opened a 2015 to see how my impressions were holding up.\n\nImperial Russian Stout has been widely venerated for quite some time now - with good reason. It ages well. It has a recipe that has been consistent and well balanced for quite some time. Like many other Russian Imperial Stouts, it is quite heavily hopped - so it has potential to mature over long periods of time, only gaining complexity as the hops become more subdued.\n\nI wish that I had had the forethought to open a comparable Russian Imp alongside Stone\'s, but here were my impressions: the beer pours quite dark, with a nice head of very light brown foam. It smells quite hoppy still, but also warm and chocolatey. The taste is quite accurate to the smell - the hops are pungent and hit the back of my tongue quite powerfully. Much like Surly Darkness, I found myself wishing that I had aged this for much longer. Those hops hang on forever! Still, the beer has admirable complexity and flavor. The hops are strong and pronounced, but there is still a very pleasant sweetness to it.\n\nI like this beer a lot. I have a 2011 and a 2013 that I have yet to open. My follow-up on those in the future.Sep 02, 2017', ""4.75Amazing. I am a big fan of Stouts and Porters and this is one of the best Stouts out there. Moderate dark fruit ester and a wonderful opaque color. I agree with the comments about a significant herbal hop character.

This is a beer to be enjoyed slowly. For me, it's a step away from a masterpiece.Aug 04, 2017"", '4The appearance had a nice dark brown close to a black color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute.

The taste was very nice as it allowed a super nice sweet and roastiness to invade the tastebuds in a slight boozy pummeling of sorts. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with more of sipping aspect assigned to this brew. The carbonation finishes roasty and smooth.

Overall, the aroma is delicious!\nTaste - The taste begins with a moderately roasted taste that contains a decent showing of a cocoa flavor as well as a touch of coffee. Right from the start there is a good sum of sweetness, with it being mostly of molasses and toffee nature, but containing some of the dark fruit that was detected in the nose. The roastiness gest slightly stronger as the taste moves forward, all while the darker fruit tastes fade. At the same time, some caramel and a touch of a char and a woody taste comes to the tongue. At the end of the taste, a tiny bit of a carob taste comes to the tongue as well as a touch of a booze, leaving one with a sweeter (but not overly sweet), and dark and very easy drinking taste to linger on the tongue.\nMouthfeel – The body of the brew is one the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is quite low. For the tastes and the style, the feel is fantastic and makes for a very easy, but slow sipping and tasty brew.\nOverall – A quite nice and approachable stout.

Then sweet earthy roasted grains and malts. There is also a nice sweetness to this brew. Between the look and smell this is one inviting brew.

While crossing that grain field, straining to get a closer look at those hops, you'll sometimes trip over a gnarled root of baker’s chocolate.\n\nFeel:\nSlender and supple, like tucking the tongue under a cooling bedsheet. A low yet continual presence of breezy bubbles brings the hidden hops forward during the linger.\n\nTaste:\nReallllly subtle toasted dark malts speckled with droplets of silky, chocolate milk and topped with crushed chestnuts. A lick of licorice bitters and herbal hops chase away the sugar, maintaining the manly lineage a traditional stout should boast: smooth, roasty, and mildly bitter.\n\nOverall:\nExceedingly mild, the casual drinker may have trouble tasting anything other than “dark beer.” A good starter stout for the uninitiated.May 08, 2021"", '4A classic American stout.

That might be the Brewer's Licorice contributing.

The head is khaki-colored, with good retention and streaks of sudsy lacing left on the side of the glass. The aroma yields no real surprises - it leans towards notes of roast, espresso, baker's cocoa, and licorice. A subtle hoppy quality really perks it up without overwhelming the senses. Taste-wise, there are no real surprises. While roasted malt and espresso are the primary notes, a dark chocolate undercurrent is the X-factor that makes this stout achieve Flavortown. It finishes with a faint hop kick, offering just enough to cleanse the palate. The finish also meshes beautifully with the creamy, lush texture, keeping it decently dry while still offering the softness I love in a good stout. Carbonation is fairly low.

Carbonation tingles the tongue, chocolate is there but not a Willy Wonka dream. One reviewer claims it improves as it warms, so I\'ll try to resist guzzling for now, but it\'s good stuff. Definitely smoother as it warms, and more bourbon and coffee flavors. Getting frothy as I swirl it in mouth. Given it\'s a ""breakfast Stout"", would probably be good with pancakes. Definitely better as it heats to room temperature ( or at 12% ABV, maybe it\'s me). Feed the cats (they love it when I sit on the floor). Beer warms some more. Chocolate seems more pronounced now.

This is more like someone tried to make an Amber Lager, and wound up messing up their recipe and decided to make a hybrid between an Amber Ale and an IPA/IPL. This beer is not to style, and I do not recommend it unless you think IPL’s are the pinnacle of beer (which they are not). It tastes almost as if someone followed the recipe to Sam Adams Boston Lager (to me is more of an ale), then decided to ramp up the hops and shorten the brew process to 2 weeks. It is actually reminiscent of the old Sam Adams Rebel line of IPA’s.Jan 18, 2020', '3.5Bottle brewed in Sweden.\n\nIt pours a clear, amber body with a tiny bit of visible carbonation, and a thick white head with good amount of lacing.\n\nThe aroma has grapefruit, honey and grassy hops with notes of raisins.\n\nIt has a mild taste of bready malts, pine, and grapefruit with slight sweetness.

Turns out I was exactly right, which was pretty disappointing as I was wanting a lager. Almost sickly sweet caramel flavor with some piney/citrusy flavor to it. Small hint of vienna malty-ness comes through, but pretty much drinks like your old school pale ale. \nOverall: Seems like an ancient beer from the mid 90\'s when craft beer was trying to gain a foothold, so they made a ""lager"" that would bring in the budweiser drinkers who only knew lagers. It was probably good for the time, but a beer like this wouldn\'t even make it to flagship status at a new brewery nowadays.

It tries a little harder than most and thus succeeds in putting a little umph usually missing in this style.\n\nIt is not a pretty red, more of a dirty copper. The head is good. The aroma is a bit stankier than yer garden variety lager. It pushes the envelope with finishing hops.\n\nThe taste is a much more bitter experience than you would expect, all thanks to a high dosage of hops. It all still seems appropriate for the style.

Not hop burn but definitely heavy-hitting in that regard. Malts hit the tongue followed by the immediate hop tingle. Crackery/buttery flavors in midstream give way to a multifaceted hop assault consistent with the aromas. Citrus, floral, earthy, grassy, resiny and weedy flavors are all there swirling around in a very complex stew. Yet the bitterness, like the malt, remains balanced and restrained.

There's an earthy, peppery spice carrying through, white grape, and raw honey all combine to make an odd but not bad scent\n\nOh yeah, that's a fuck ton of saffron in the taste, not really something you expect in a beer, even though this is brewed with it. The honey comes though strong in the beginning, sweet and unrefined, and only gets sweeter as the sip progresses. However, there are tart fruit notes to finish, mostly white grape, peach, and green apple. Oddly enough, the flavor reminds me of some strange nitro energy drink I had years ago that I think was supposed to be grape flavored and had some spice as well\n\nPretty light body and mild carbonation, this thing bounces back and forth between tart and sweet to keep things interesting. Finishes just off dry\n\nA perplexing beer for sure. One could argue that this is a great example of a beer with non traditional ingredients and pulls it off due to lack of expectations.

Imagine if cotton candy were ghost and that'd put you near the mark of this ale's magical mouthfeel. A caress of sinful silk with a dry, Riesling finish.\n\nTaste:\nHoneycomb slathered in sweet, golden nectar. The honey aspect is earthy and intensely real. Not store-bought honey, not honey flavoring, more like: caveman who owns his own beehive, honey.

Some lacing at first that eventually goes away.\n\nSmell: The nose on this pops with sweet and bready grains, and bright, vinous white grape that has white wine qualities. Apple and apple skin. Honeysuckle. As the beer warms the ABV becomes slightly noticeable, but not in a distracting way. \n\nTaste: The taste is sweeter than the nose suggests, and the honey really comes out in the flavor. It’s bit heavier on the palate than the nose, as the white wine quality gets a bit lost with the sweetness. Quite bready and sweet with some yeast esters showing. The beer does dry out a bit. \n\nFeel: Medium level of carbonation that offers some nice lively body to the sweet flavor. Starts sweet and dries out. \n\nOverall: The nose on this beer is great.

Very odd, but bright, aroma. Flavor profile is dense, layering notes of safron with tart, juicy grapes, orange rind, and honey. Malts form a light bready, earthy base, but the overall consistency is 'sweet'. Mouth feel is lightly pulpy with that suspended grain playing a role within the texture.

I would recommend it for a beer on the go at a party or gathering. Not the greatest but better than Bud or Coors in my opinion.May 08, 2021"", ""5I'm gonna start by saying that Miller Highlife is very underrated and has been stereotyped because typical American adjunct lagers are so terrible. So many people drink Bud light and think it's a really great beer and its very overrated. In order to enjoy American lagers you have to modify it with salt and lime. I live in Texas 60 miles from the border of Mexico so homemade micheladas are common. Now I'm gonna talk about why I think that Miller Highlife is by far the best American lager out of all the commercial beers. I just recently picked up a 12 pack of bottles at the dollar store for about 8 bucks. I also picked up ice to ice it down which is the first step to making this beer taste so damn good. You need good key limes and a sea salt grinder. After you ice down the beer pour some salt over the ice. Doesn't have to be much. Salt drops the freezing point of water down into the teens. 18 or 19 degrees without freezing anything. Once the beers have had time to get cold grab one and twist off the top and squeeze a half of a key lime into the beer and then use it to wipe down the entire neck of the bottle. Now find a way to tilt your beer because you will be using both hands to grind the sea salt and cover all the way around the neck lightly. Now sprinkle just a little bit into the beer enough to cause the temperature to drop below freezing without freezing the beer. This is what makes it all happen. It makes this beer the crispiest and most refreshing beer and goes down so easy that you will devour the beers without realizing it because the taste is so good. If anybody tries this it has to be step by step or else you won't get the same experience. I promise that you will like it more than you think. Oh and the when the beer is at almost 32 degrees it won't foam up when you add a small pinch of sea salt to drop the temp even lower. It shouldn't be enough to make the beer taste salty. This will change your mind about Miller Highlife. I am giving it 5 stars because I got hooked on em to where I crave the taste all the time. I hope somebody gets to try it this way. Other lagers won't work like this. Champagne of beers in bottles only. Miller deserves better credit for Highlife. The other Miller beers are awful like MGD and Lite.May 03, 2021"", ""3.5Good beer in the style. Very good beer for the cost.

Perfect for easy-drinking enjoyment that doesn\'t cost too much (I\'ve been getting them for $9.99 a twelve-pack at the local Krogers) and isn\'t a dreaded light beer.

Highly carbonated bubbles stream to the top of the brew and for a beer, in a clear bottle, there are no signs of skunking thanks to the fully enclosed box I got this in. \n\nThe first sip is a rush of sweetness, mostly from corn and yeast that really overpowers the mild malt notes. The malt is nothing overly special but does a good job supporting the beer throughout the total flavor. Ultra drinkable, even at 4.6% ABV there are little to no signs of alcohol in the taste. Hop notes are spicy, and really there to support the adjunct but noticeable in the rears. Very high quality of water is used to produce a solid adjunct lager.\n\nBetween the big brands, this is one of the better examples of an adjunct lager. Though I believe Coors Banquet is a bit overly corny, HL has similar notes but a better blend of hops and yeast in the finish.

It wasn't until the release of Bud Light in 82 (nearly 9 years later) did the popularity of Miller's flagship diet beer slow down. Then the brand saw a flood of new 'diet' beers hit the market slowed down its popularity in the 80s with a huge share of all American beer made by 10 main breweries with less than 20% of smaller local breweries. \nThere is no denying the influence Miller Lite has on the American beer drinker. Sales steadily rose for several decades, but by 2010 era Lite was considered to be a 'sub-premium' priced product in the eyes of the consumer and sales floundered. But alongside a relaunch of the products branding, television ads and partnerships overhyped the demand and cost rose alongside it. Even today I paid $1.5 more compared to Keystone, a similar adjunct lager from the same MillerCoors brand. \n\nPouring a SRM 5 there is a massive lively head that leaves a bit of white soapy lacing from the can condition pour. Scent of lager yeast and sweetness. \n\nMouthfeel is light, ultra thin body, highly drinkable though the adjunct is in your face throughout the entire presentation. Considering this beer is supposed to be a pilsner, I am disappointed by the hoppiness and the overwhelming adjunct flavor throughout the presentation. The fronts are a bit grainy, light malt character nothing too in your face, then the corn hits the mids and the rears, a spiciness lingers throughout the mid/finish and comes off with a bit dry finish but the sweetness lingers on. \n\nConsidering all light beer options, this is not amazing or bad, it is just what it is. I think if you compared other AAL-light beers I'd say the flavor of Miller is more appealing than Budweiser, but not as great as Michelob Light.

I’m not usually a stout drinker although I do enjoy them occasionally, especially when seasons change to the cooler time of year. I picked up\nA 6 pack of Sierra Nevada Narwhal Imperial stout in 12 oz bottles at the local liquor store this weekend and gave it a try this evening.

I’m not picking up the sweetness of molasses in the taste but I do notice some of the expected earthy molasses undertones or maybe it’s peat (as I imagine peat would taste). A bit of bitter hops bite as well, which I appreciated. The hops in the finish worked well to counter the strong malty base. \nF: this is definitely a heavy bodied beer. I enjoyed the thickness and the carbonation as they competed. It definitely added to the complexity of the drinking experience. \nO: I was surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. It actually reminded me of a stout (brand and name I do not recall) that I had in San Diego way back in the late 1980s at a small English pub just a couple of blocks north of downtown and a couple of blocks from San Diego Bay. \n\nThis Sierra Nevada Imperial stout might be my favorite among cold weather, seasonal offerings I’ve tried. Qualifier: I don’t drink many stouts or porters regularly so my reference is a bit limited, but I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and I’m looking forward to having the remaining 5 for nightcaps over the next several days. I might even consider cellaring a bottle for down the road.Oct 14, 2020', ""4.52020 bottle - poured into a flared ale glass at 38°F. \n\nPours a deep used motor oil brown, sitting black as night in the glass - impenetrable to light. Half a finger of mocha brown head forma before quickly receding to a razor-thin tan collar. \n\nNose: Bold roasted malt wafts out of the glass with notes of blackened barley, baking cocoa, and espresso, with lighter notes of caramel, toffee, malted milk, molasses, and perhaps just a whisper of earthy hops. Slightly subdued, but very classic. \n\nPalate: Narwhal greets the palate with a huge flood of deeply roasted malt. It's instantly rather sweet, and translates to the palate like liquid dark chocolate. There's some caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, and a healthy amount of roasted malt, but it isn't acrid, charry, or smoky. That subtle malted milk ball note also translates to the palate. Perhaps the best part of this is the hop presence. While very restrained in the nose, it's beautifully integrated here. It isn't piney, spicy, or fruity, but rather earthy and musty, very much like boiled Simcoe. Extremely similar to the pronounced Simcoe note in Hopslam and Pliny. This hoppy note peaks mid-way through the finish, where the malty sweetness greatly subsides, allowing a gently dry roastiness to emerge, pairing with the hops, and concluding with cacao nib, black malt, vanilla, and leafy hops in a dry, bold, slightly earthy finish. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: Narwhal is surprisingly full-bodied. It greets the palate fluid, and then quickly takes on a richness that isn't viscous, but definitely gives a little bit to chew on. It remains very drinkable, partly due to the adequate effervescence and toasty finish, and never becomes cloying or heavy. \n\nOverall: This is such a classic Russian imperial stout, with a few unique components. The West Coast hop influence is beautiful, and really captures the Sierra Nevada spirit. The perfect balance between malty sweetness and roastiness is unparalleled. It's a classic, old world Russian imperial stout, with a modern twist, and it is really quite perfect for what it is.Sep 27, 2020"", ""3.75LOOK - super dark / black - 1 finger head after pouring from a 12oz bottle but it disappears very quickly - slight ring of bubbles cling on to the outer circumference\nSMELL - some charred grains, molasses, coffee, and hint of chocolate - not very aromatic\nTASTE - super powerful blast of bitter charred grains and bitter hops - some coffee and barely any chocolate - stays very dry and tart and never sweetens up with any malt or caramel - some molasses, burnt sugar, and tobacco \nFEEL - full bodied beer but basically goes flat after a few minutes - could have benefited from some more carbo\nOVERALL - I have heard a lot about this beer for years and finally got the opportunity to try it.

I wholly appreciate how this dank herbal brew is kind of the opposite of so many IPAs on the scene here in the PNW. It has a pretty substantial caramel malty backbone that is distinctive like Rueben’s but less marmalade. The sweetness is mellowed by the bitterness, but it’s not too resinous, thick, but far from watery either. Somehow, this ABV is perfect for a nice buzz but way more sessionable than many IPAs out, maybe that’s a good thing if your planning a hangout outside with your buds. This herbal/malt profile also seems more aligned with this winter season so there’s another positive point. I did get this on tap so I’m not sure if I’d appreciate this as much if it sat around for more than a month and several weeks in the shelves.

An excellent beer.Jun 03, 2020', ""4.75This is potentially my favorite beer. Even though it isn't as complex or decadent as some beers, it is drinkable, full of flavor, and at what I consider to be the perfect ABV. \n\nLook: Typical amber style in terms of color and clarity, but with a small ever-present head that gives it a sense of smoothness you don't always get from other hoppy beers. \n\nSmell: Immediately extremely fruity, like a freshly peeled citrus. Hops and malt combine with bitter and sweet to provide this experience. Slightly dank and herbaceous, rounding out the smell with a full and complex undertone. \n\nTaste: Malt and hops combine together on the first sip, giving the signature fruity bitterness. Hop bitterness is very high at 93 IBU, and lasts for quite a while in the mouth. Each subsequent sip refreshes you and starts the process over again; this beer can be enjoyed in sips over a long period of time, or finished off quickly if you desire. You'll both want to go back for the next sip, but also linger on the last one. As for the particular fruit taste here, it could really be a few. I get mango, grapefruit, but also some orange and possibly even some notes of dried fruit. The head gives every sip a creamy flavor as well. Almost like if you were to have an orange creamsicle with real fruit flavors as opposed to artificial orange flavor. Dank in the flavor as well, adds a lot of complexity here. \n\nFeel: Creamy, but not overly heavy. Perfect feel for this style of beer, and works with the fruit flavors very well. \n\nOverall: This beer is fantastic, provided you enjoy hoppy beers. It can serve different drinking purposes (despite being labeled an Imperial, you can drink a few at a time), and will be sure to satisfy. Personally I might bump the ABV up just a notch to 8-8.5%, but other than that, this beer is nearly flawless. Next time you want a Double IPA, try this instead. It provides a similar experience, but with a more gentle and smooth malt than the typical intense malts of DIPAs.

I really had to breathe deep to detect anything at all.\n\nTaste:\nBold, shameless hops cut to the front of the line, jumping up and down for attention, shoving the semi-sweet honey, caramels, red malts, and floral spices sprawling to the ground on its oafish way there. The flavors injured by this carelessness still come limping along, but weaker for their sufferance. At times, there's even a hint of something that wants to call itself mango creamsicle, but those citrus hops relentlessly rave and whoop across the palate with bombastic abandon, while the more exotic flavors are subdued into stunned whispers. \n\nFeel:\nA medium body that's smooth and finishes with a warm, bitter bite. Refreshing, almost crisp, and most inoffensive!\n\nOverall:\nA daydream of captivating flavors that never quite becomes reality. Nugget Nectar is nice, yeah... but not a World-Class 96 out of 100.

Nearly two fingers of bone white head form, before receding to a half-finger of sheet that persists throughout. Absolutely mesmerising effervescence that begins nucleating at the base with micro bubbles, before growing and absolutely swarming upwards, keeping that sheet of foam alive. Some heavy sheet lacing is formed. \n\nNose: That unique red ale malt base sets the tone - not nearly as sweet and honey-like as caramel malt, and also restrained enough to let the hops take the spotlight. Some warm, toasty notes, with a touch of caramel and fresh baked bread, and then a ton of hop notes. The hops are very bizarre. There's a real English floral and spiciness to it that you almost never encounter in an American hoppy ale. There are some very forward pine and citrus notes, but then this bombardment of dank and earthy impressions hit. I definitely get some Simcoe mustiness and touch of black peppercorn, but the rest is just this very unique bouquet of dank, earthy, spicy, and floral notes. .\n\nPalate: The beer greets the palate with a malty sweetness first and foremost. Somewhat akin to typical crystal malt, there is a moderate sweetness, but it lacks the darker, toasty caramel flavour. The sweetness is actually somewhat restrained. The hops comenin quick, with a whole mosaic (not the hop) of earthy, spicy, and dank notes, with a little hint if bright fruity citrus. A firm boiled hop bitterness - pithy and resibous in nature, comes into focus fairly early on, but is kept beneath everything else by the malt. These are unusual hops to me, and therefore I cannot say what it typical of them, or even identify what flavours are from what, but I can absolutely spot some musty, earthy Simcoe in the mix, from a mile away. It tastes like they added Simcoe in boil, but also used it in the dry hop as well. European hop spice, grapefruit, tangerine, black pepper, Douglas fir sap, fresh herbs, a bit of grass, and all these earthy notes, with that punch of musty Simcoe. The finish dries out much of the malt, and sees an increase in bitterness, which becomes purely resinous, with all the spicy notes from before, some dry potpourri florals, dried orange zest, and a ton of sappy, resinous hop oils, which lends a bit of pine. Bitterness does not linger, and the finish ultimately concludes clean and crisp. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: The beer is squarely medium-bodied. The malt lends some sweetness, some heft, and just a hint of stickiness, but I've had regular old West Coast IPAs that are way sweeter and stickier than this. It is quite crisp and drinkable, and the malt never feels chewy, heavy or sticky. Effervescence is fairly average, or maybe just a bit below average, but for all intents and purposes, it's perfectly adequate, and helps move the beer along. Some resinous hop oils cling to the palate, and while not entirely dry, the finish definitely has some hoppy drying qualities. \n\nOverall: I have to give this beer credit for being unique and a bit against the grain. I've had some red ales before, and while some hit the mark, others just come across as IPAs - often overly bitter and sappy IPAs. This was has a character that is entirely it's own. The malt is absolutely perfect, and really sets the feel for a red ale, the hops themselves are just ridiculously unique and unusual, and the hopping is done to perfection, with the perfect balance of bitterness, flavour, and aromatics. This is a very fine imperial red ale - a bit unusual, yes, and perhaps not what many are used to, but it's a job well done, and a finely crafted ale.Feb 04, 2020"", '4.2512oz can freshest by 04/22/2020 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7.5% ABV 93 IBU.

The taste is semisweet burnt sugar caramel with big dank hoppy overtones of evergreen and mango. Heavy bitterness throughout.

Nut Brown Ale,Brown Ale - English,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),5,4.1,"['4Lovely reddish brown colour. Thick, brown-tinged, off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves thick bands of lacing. Toasty malts on the nose, hint of chocolate, caramel, and red wine. Barley and malt are prominent in the taste, finish is subtle red wine and even subtler licorice. Nutty flavour is not as pronounced as I had hoped. Feel is rounded, refreshing, and not sweet at all, in a good way. Overall a solid English brown ale, if not extremely special.Aug 22, 2021', '4My sampling was taken from a 4 pack of 16oz cans. I did a traditional easy pour at 45 degrees. The medium brown beer formed a light, cream head with larger bubbles in the foam than you’d find in most stouts. The foam formed tall calling for a pause to the pour to let it settle before pouring the rest.\n\nThe foam quickly settled to a thick lace around the parameter which lasted through to the bottom of the glass. The beer is warm brown with a slightly yellow appearance at the margin.\n\nThe smell is subtle of light wood and sweet caramel. Upon the first sip I tasted the sweetness like caramel with hints of hearty nuts (such as walnut, but not exactly) and earthy, root. The feel is medium thickness but not chewy. The low carbonation creates a consistent feel from the front to the back. Slight bitterness that fads quickly.\n\nOverall, this is a surprising refreshing brown ale without any stand-out negatives. This is a brown ale that any beer drinker can appreciate. My take away is that if I could pleasantly drink a tree (root, trunk and nut), then this would be it. Be one with a tree, try this beer if you can find it!Aug 15, 2021', '4.25Small head, dissipate quickly. Medium carbonation. Dark brown color. Nice body, like creamy.

One thing about English Ale's in general- you know what to expect. The reason a lot of people deviated from US made pales, is because how much flavor has migrated from the release year in last 20 years for lots of iconic brands. Take Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, as a true presenter of the style and a true classic. It is nowhere near the flavor I remember from back in the day.

Definitely fits the ""oaky"" descriptor either way. \n\nTaste has a nice touch of chocolate to it despite having no chocolate in it. The roasted malt is so pervasive that you get a coffee like component despite having no coffee. Good brewing technique and ingredients there. The oak remains pronounced, the bitterness is real, the alcohol is relatively innocuous taste wise despite almost being 10%.

Chocolate and hint of vanilla follow, then super reduced maple, to the extreme, combined with the oak to bring in a sort of peppered bacon smell.\n\nI taste that freshly dry, nearing cedar, oak flavor, which is just so divine to be absolutely absent of bourbon. I then get rich roasted chocolate malt and a surprising abundance of piney hops. Surprising because I enjoy it, and it doesn't turn me off at all.\n\nThe feel starts with a sharp tang, and a moderate to surprisingly thin body at times.

OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,Strong Ale - American,Arrogant Consortia,7.2,4.23,"['3.7512 fl. oz. bottle, thanks to my son Steinar. ABV is 7.2%. Cloudy dark brown colour, big and creamy tan head. Very nice aroma of fruity American hops and oak, blackcurrants, marmelade, some vinous notes too. The mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring, then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in, accompanied by oaky and smoky notes. Very bitter aftertaste. An ""arrogant"" beer, perhaps - but not quite as arrogant as I feared. I am worthy!Mar 20, 2021', '4.25Reviewed from notes.\n\nPours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap.\n\nThe smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There\'s enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves.\n\nThe taste delivers on what\'s promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience.\n\nEverything lingers into the aftertaste. It\'s got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer ""feels good"".\n\nOverall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done.Sep 03, 2019', '4.25From notes 1/25/12: Pours a rich but murky brown with a reddish tint. Develops a 1.5 inch, frothy, tan, moderately lasting head that leaves nice clumpy lacing. Aroma is resinous pine hops, oaky vanilla, dark malt roast and a hint of toffee. Taste is piney hops up front and woody vanilla with hints of toffee and caramel. The ""oaking"" process does something that greatly subdues the fig, prune, molasses bread and fruitcake flavors found in Arrogant Bastard original.

Of the Arrogant Bastard family this is the one with the most shy bouquet, though it is still assertive. \n\nThis is by far the most subtle of the Bastards. That aggressiveness in the flavors is not present here, and the sweet and bitter spikes also lack. That is not say that this beer is flavorless or dull, at all. \nUpfront you get humble sweet notes of caramel, malts and booze. Almost at the same time, a subdued bitter note enters, and it quickly gains prominence until it overcomes completely that initial sweetness and it becomes clear that it is oak what we are talking about. A raw wood flavor.\nThe aftertaste is mostly bitter with that same oak note.

Starts with strong herbal hops and strong oak, hops are nearly astringent, flavors of basil and even a hint of dried mint leaf, oak is very woody and wet, there are just hints of the sweet plum and dark toffee struggling in the background, but darkened toffee quickly comes forward with a light roastiness that joins the herbal hops and oak. Finish is strong oak and herbal hops that nearly pucker. \n\nMouthfeel - nearly medium, as carb is definitely on the lower side allowing the oak and herbs to dominate the palate. Very smooth and almost creamy, but the hop and oak assault make you think otherwise. Astringent finish.\n\nOverall - i love arrogant bastard and double bastard - and this one is good too, but I want to try another bottle to make sure. I do enjoy this beer, quite a bit, but the bastard caught me off guard with the intensity of hops and barrel - not a bad thing, I'm enjoying it for sure, but want one more just for comparison.

Served slightly chilled.\n\nLooks a lot like standard Bastard - foggy copper-amber hue with brick red highlights, and equipped with a nearly one-inch crown of creamy, buff-coloured head. Great retention; it lasts the better part of ten minutes before receding completely, coating the glass with a messy layer of lacing as it steadily creeps ever downward. A lumpy cap and generous collar survive afterwards. Looks perfect to me, but the aroma is comparatively humble - light notes of buttery oak and vanilla come through, with the remainder being a toned-down derivative of the base beer. Bready, toasty malt and toffee/caramel sweetness, with additional notes of pine resin, citrus and dried orchard fruit.\n\nThis strong ale has a familiar backbone consisting of lightly toasted bready malts and toffee sweetness, combining with a hint of prune fruitiness. The hops rush in on the back end, providing that intense bitterness you've come to expect from this brand: oily pine resin and pithy grapefruit citrus. Finishes with floral notes, ethanol and woody oak chip flavours that dry the palate out almost completely, leaving an astringent feeling on the tongue. Medium-bodied, with middling carbonation levels that gently prickle the palate, resulting in a relatively soft, creamy mouthfeel. \n\nFinal Grade: 4.27, a high A-. Oaked Arrogant Bastard is more of a sideways step than a forward one - it's a very nice beer, but IMO I'm not sure if the oak chips really improved it much. The relentless resiny bitterness and bold grapefruit citrus flavours are still there, as is the equally-sturdy malt backbone. The oak chips serve mostly to dry the finish out considerably, playing mostly a supporting role in the flavour profile itself. I encourage everyone who enjoyed the standard Bastard to give this one a shot, as it's certainly a good variant on a rock-solid theme.Jan 02, 2016"", '4Purchased at the LCBO as part of a 4pk of 650ml bottles for $35.00.

Seriously,a seasoned palate is best to break this one down. It is AB, but the tannins from the oak amplify the bitterness. But, wait! There is more! The char and oak contribute a level of smokiness and booziness (perhaps bourbon?) that meet the base recipe of AB that I am having trouble putting into words--at the very least, it is incredibly enjoyable. Any person who has cut their teeth on Bourbon or IPA's will appreciate the subtle complexities here.\n\nLast Words: This is downright delicious!

This offering is very good. It has a nice cloudy “haze” that all good wheat beers should have, and a great taste that goes down smoothly with very little bitterness. I’m happy of my first purchase of this interesting wheat beer and the only negative I could say is the attempt to add to much hops to make it a semi-IPA. Let it be a full-fledged Wheat beer and don’t feel the need to over-hop it! This beer is great, but would be even better if it didn’t try to be an IPA, my opinion. \nThe pour, head, color & cloudiness is exactly what I look for in a wheat ale....I like this one a lot and will buy it again!

Obsidian Stout,Stout - American,Deschutes Brewery,6.4,4.21,"['4I have enjoyed this brew many times before, but never reviewed. Now is the time. A new hop to me, Delta. The malt profile promises rich creamy and sweet.\nAn impressive mousse caramel head with microbubbles forms straightaway. Appears nitro but is not. The liquid is black black as expected. Not super thick but enough for 6+ abv. Carbonation only seen when shaken.\nNose: Cocao, chocolate chip cookie, deep roasted coffee notes lingering. Dark and indulgent. Hop presences with malt. Cream. Comperable in smell to Old Rasputin.\nThe espresso notes are certainly there. It leaves the same aftertaste as biting a coffee bean. Excellent for those who enjoy. Pleasantly lighter than I expexted with a slight bite to balance the malt. There is residual booziness but when combined with the bitter espresso it works well. \nA sharp stout.\n\nAs a coffee lover this works for me. If you dislike, avoid Obsidian.

There\'s a slight ethanol flavor at the VERY end (like the last two sips). The finish is walnut and toffee, with an extremely faint floral note.\nF - Silky, creamy, and rich. Incredibly easy-to-drink, but not filling in the slightest. Full-bodied, with medium-light carbonation.\nO - An incredible brew, and one of my favorites of all time. Sam Smith aimed to make a chocolate beer, and a chocolate beer they did make! This beer feels inviting. The sort of inviting that feels like when your old hippie friend from the mountains of Western North Carolina shared a six-pack after helping him make tie-dye shirts. It\'s a certain feeling that is always weird to describe, but it evokes nostalgia and warmth for what probably happened a week ago. The chocolate notes in this beer are the stars here, and they nailed it. One would likely argue that this is a dessert beer, but I could see myself enjoying a pint of this stuff alongside a roasted duck and some mashed potatoes. It tastes heavy, but feels pretty light - sort of like a Guinness. I cannot recommend this brew enough. Even if it seems expensive (it is), it\'s worth every penny. Buy it if you see it.

I first tried this decades ago and it was one of my regular stouts, but for some reason I never reviewed it. Glad to try it again. A fine stout.May 19, 2021"", '4.25Pours a dark brown with a foamy tan head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes of sweet chocolate. Smooth and creamy. Very enjoyable.May 09, 2021', '4.75Wow! I really enjoyed this stout. Poured a dark black with a think tan head. The strong chocolate aroma was quickly evident. Wow the smell of this stout is very inviting. Chocolate was the only scent I could pickup on nothing else came through. The flavor followed the aroma. Very yummy chocolate flavors dominate the flavor profile. Mouthfeel was light and smooth very pleasant. Overall this is a great beer.Apr 10, 2021', ""4.5Poured a dark almost black color, with slight reddish hues. The head was a soapy tan foam that quickly dispersed. The smell of this stout is amazing. Right away the aroma of high quality dark chocolate hits your nose. It's not an overly artificial chocolate smell, but of the real thing. The chocolate is definitely the dominate aroma, with not much else coming though. The flavor is on par with the aroma, semisweet chocolate dominates the palate with an ever so slight burnt hop finish. The mouthfeel is pleasantly coating and smooth. This beer was reminiscent of a chocolate soda or a high quality NYC egg cream. Way to decadant to be a session beer, but this stout is world class.Feb 28, 2021"", '4.75L: Pours practically pitch black, accompanied by a tall tan/brown head with good retention. \nS: Smells of chocolate, nice roasty malts, vanilla, dark fruits. None of the aromas were very strong though.\nT: Taste very much follows the nose, has a really great coffee finish that goes great with the sweet milk chocolate flavor. \nF: Somewhat thin for the style, medium-bodied, low carbonation, exceptionally smooth though.\nO: Straight-up this stout is truly bitchin, I really was impressed with this one. The only thing I would change would be bumping the ABV up just a notch to add a warming effect to this brew.Feb 27, 2021', ""4.5As far as English stouts are concerned this is the epitome with its just barely world class rating. Having looked down the list, the amount of SS's had's verses other beers within the style, should be enough to tell you this is simply the best comparably to others. As expected this beer pours a beautiful chocolate hued black, creating a mild head that diminished to a light coco coloured lacing on top. \n\nChocolate in smell, this is not too much that is detectable from the scent. Similar to the smell the semi-sweet chocolate flavor balanced by a hefty roasted malt backbone and 50+ ibu's makes for an ultra smooth desert beer. Though slightly syrupy in texture the finish is mellow and packs a bit of a hoppy kick, especially at the 5% mark. The mouthfeel is full bodied, as expected, and the sweetness is a bit more bitter than overly sweet as the flavors resemble semi-sweet chocolate bars with a rounded overall balance between notes. There is a mild creaminess in the beers overall texture but rounded in overall mouthfeel.\n\nNeedless to say it is a gem of a beer and belongs in there in the 'must-have' for any beer drinker to try. This would be a masterful choice if found on tap conditioning as I feel like the bottle conditioning is not as smooth as you'd find on draught or as a real ale.Feb 27, 2021"", '4Currently ranked #1 in the Top ""Stout - English"" list with an overall score of 95.\n\nI nabbed a 4-pack of 355ml bottles at a Total Wine & More (Metairie, Louisiana) for $12.99 USD plus tax.\n\n""Organic Chocolate Stout.""

Excellent frothiness. Excellent (~10+ minute) head retention.\n\nBody is true to style...opaque black. No yeast/lees are visible within, but of course it\'s opaque...still, it does look filtered.\n\nAppears perfectly carbonated. Nails the style appearance-wise. Wisps of lacing cling to the sides of my glass as the head recedes. Certainly an enticing brew....sumptuous.\n\nAROMA: More subdued/less intense than I\'d imagined coming in...yes, it evokes chocolate malt and cocoa extract, but it doesn\'t hit you over the head with it. Faint roasted barley and dark malts/black malts back the cocoa with malt sweetness and roasty almost coffee-like bitterness, complementing it well. Aroma promises a chocolate stout that\'s perfectly balanced; so many American chocolate stouts are overly sweet but this packs enough roasted barley in that it seems perfectly dialed in.\n\nTrue to the style, no overt yeasty or hoppy aromatics are obvious.\n\nOne of the most genuine cocoa aromas I\'ve encountered in any beer.\n\nTASTE & TEXTURE: Silky soft with a bit of dryness up front from the roasted barley. Aptly medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. Not too thick or syrupy like many chocolate stouts.\n\nThe creaminess and softness of its texture accentuates the gooey chocolate malts at its core and coaxes out more depth of chocolate flavour from the cocoa. I don\'t taste any cidery off-flavour despite the beer\'s use of cane sugar. True to style, no overt hoppy flavours are noticeable and the English ale yeast leaves this drinking clean with just the right amount of residual sugars.\n\nIt flirts with a malted milk ball flavour but luckily never quite delves too deep into it (I\'m not a fan personally).\n\nIt\'s impeccably well balanced, harmonizing faint roasted barley with its chocolatey flavours. The chocolate/cocoa always tastes genuine, which is more than I can say about most chocolate beers (including those that actually do use real chocolate). This is the rare beer brewed with ""natural"" flavors that actually tastes natural.\n\nFinishes on a chocolatey sweetness that rings authentic. This never tastes like Hershey\'s syrup or garbage American chocolates, but to pick a nit, it doesn\'t quite evoke the best chocolate out there (Belgian, Swiss, et al.). Still, Belgian chocolate is a bit too powdery to feel right in beer form and Swiss is probably too rich.\n\nOVERALL: I didn\'t expect such roastiness in an English chocolate stout, but its presence is welcome and speaks to the brewers\' mastery of balance. Or maybe they\'re just ripping a page out of Guinness\' handbook. In any case, it\'s an even keeled chocolate stout with a genuine taste. I could imagine the chocolate character itself a bit more expressive and the beer overall better in terms of depth of flavour, but this is a stupidly drinkable 5% ABV stout that isn\'t trying to compete with the crazy intense imperial stouts dominating the scene across the pond. And I could easily crush multiple pints in a single sitting, which is more than I can say about most chocolate beers/chocolate stouts.\n\nA classic, and a top tier expression of the style.\n\nHigh B (3.74) / GOODFeb 24, 2021', '4.75Drank this bottle over the course of two days.

As my palate adjusted and the beer warmed, the juicy qualities intensified along with the funky notes on the nose. The bitterness also mellowed pleasantly and worked well with a somewhat dry finish. The hops brought some brightness with their grassy and sometimes floral notes. The initial ample carbonation was almost unpleasant upon the first sips.

Very saison-like, but very pale aleish as well. I like it. In fact I think I love it.

Not much else to say except that this is highly recommended!Mar 20, 2021"", ""4Appearance: Poured with two fingers of fluffy head that retained exceptionally well and produced a solid amount of lacing. The body is an opaque cloudy brown that leans a bit more towards amber when put up to the light, and is just translucent enough to see the ample carbonation rising from the bottle of the goblet I poured it into. The only thing stopping it from a perfect here is more lacing, and maybe a bit less brown, which I don't really expect in a Pale ale.\n\nSmell: The smell here is everything I would expect from a hike in the country after the rain. I catch wet earth, with mild flowers of the forest, apricots, pear, figs and a hint of plum from the orchard, and grain and barnwood from the farm with maybe a flight bit of grapefruit and while it's probably not the best way to describe it, all with a slight after rain funk. Really that funk, not being able to place it, is my biggest complaint and that it's a bit off putting, but it's kept mild.\n\nTaste: There is a dry leather funk that permeates the beer, and it's a bit more potent then I would like it to be, but it stays to the background, as it starts with grapefruit, multi-grain bread and a hint of clove that gives way to pear and fig before floral and earthy hops take over and round things out with a slight black pepper touch. The beer constantly evolves as apricot, wood and orange make appearances. The only constant though is that dry leather funk, which I really wish would go.\n\nMouthfeel: While the funk departs in the aftertaste, the dry part doesn't which is a bit of a downer. That transitioning is great, save that ever present funk. The carbonation is great as it helps out the entire beer and the aftertaste is a nice cinnamon and allspice raisin bread with a floral element to it. \n\nDrinkability: Medium bodied, although that seems a bit deceptive given the ample carbonation, and that is made known after it is consumed. There are two major things that I am finding undesirable, the leather funk and the dry aftertaste. They are conspiring to make me partake of one to temporarily stop the other, which while is making me drink it fast, is doing so for the wrong reasons. Thankfully, the other flavorful notes in the beer, and mild aftertaste in brings to the table outweigh these concerns.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I was warned ahead of time, that Orval is by far the weirdest of the Trappist brews, and I can see why. It's got a strange funk to it (which seems to be identified in other reviews as Brettanomyces) which I don't seem to care for, but I know it is playing some kind of major role in the aspects of the beer I like, as there is a lot going on with this one. This is a pale ale, so I'm willing to excuse a bit of dryness, and by all accounts the strengths here, overpower the weaknesses. I'm honestly curious how this one will fare if given some time to mellow out or age. Thankfully I bought two bottles, which pretty much sums up this beer.

Yet the espresso is balanced by a blend of sweet and bitter chocolates and cinnamon roll dough. Along with an iron metallic afterthought, this beer smells like it should. A stout, with coffee.\n\nIn some ways, the flavor excels. The chocolate notes take on a more baked brownie burned edge (the best part). It's sweet at first, but then that coffee comes in, full, roasty, bitter. Somewhere in the between, a nuttiness struggles for attention. Hazelnut might be the closest I can claim. In the finish, the aforementioned iron-metallic/ mineral quality lingers.\n\nSweetness has its moment of glory, but it is quickly overcome by roast, char, and bitter onslaughts.

Sure, perhaps. But not many can claim as few as adjuncts while still delivering amount of complexities in both flavor and aroma.

The smell is sweet and piny, nice and smooth with a nice thick forestry sting. The taste is pure hops. You can definitely feel the alcohol but you technically can't tast it cause of the power of the hops. The feel is heavy like a stout with a nice finish that reminds you of a morning coffee.

Alcohol of 9.5% is well disguised.\nAlthough this brew has a brutal hop addition, I felt this DIPA relatively very well balanced, no room for those caramel bombs with heavy body brews we often see in the style.

The colour is straight up apple juice. Head is good at first, big loose bubbles, but dissipates to nothing within minutes, leaving little to no lacing. Big biscuit and grainy malt on the nose, then a distinct but gentle hops character. The taste starts very balanced and mild, a very subtle maltiness with a strong hop undercurrent, but the hops build and build towards a bright, spicy, floral, crisp finish. I'm struck by the thought that this would go extremely well with pizza or pasta, cutting through the creaminess of the sauce with its sharp and crisp feel nicely. My personal preference is stronger malt character and subtler hops, but I understand this is the style, and that being said this type of hops is much more pleasant to me than fruity American hops.

Carbonation bubbles dance to the top of the head from the bottom of the glass. To the nose, piney/floral aromas tickle your nostrils. A sip and immediately you are met by a light bitterness, but a very fresh hoppy and pine like taste. A slight citrus aftertaste and each time you put it down, you are lured quickly to the next sip.

Nonetheless, it is still a good beer.\n\nEdit: Having had this side by side to other pilsners, this falls far short. Overly hopped, not nearly enough malt in the base to balance the absurd amount of hops. Simply too hop forward to quench the thirst or even simply enjoy. This drinks more like a pale ale or india pale lager. The high rating on this and other sites simply means the reviewers around here just like overly hopped liquids. This is not a good example of a pilsner, let alone a german pils.Oct 06, 2020', ""3.75Appearance, is yellow and fizzy with a large white head. Strong aroma of floral hops.

Toppling is by far , one of top breweries that continually puts out great product and this one is no different.Sep 06, 2021', '4.25Looking at this impenetrable haze of murky yellow-peach colored concoction isn’t pretty, but the billowing white foam and lacing portends exceptional craftsmanship. One smell, and the pungent aroma of grapefruit, orange, mango, and pineapple confirms exquisite quality. Great tasting, but a bit boring. Should be on an index card for the absolute standard in easy drinking, hazy pale ales. Flavors of orange and grapefruit and mango burst through. Bitter without being too bitter, a tinge of grassy earthiness without being too floral, everything is in balance and in moderation. Velvety smooth, light mouthfeel with good carbonation.Aug 28, 2021', '4.5Canned on 7/02/21 and enjoyed in a 16oz Founders snifter on 8/27/21.\nAppearance: Pours a pale straw-colored yellow reminiscent of watered-down orange juice color with about a finger of foam. Very murky and opaque due to the amount of haze, almost has that look like it would glow in the dark if I turned off the lights. Chunks of floating sediment and nice lacing down the glass. \n\nSmell: Nose consists of heavy amounts of citrus, mostly orange and mango with more subtle lemon, lime, and grapefruit. Subtle amounts of earthy tones with sweet smelling grass and floral notes complimented a bit of onion and spicy garlic. Pine and resin also present but are more subtle than the citrus and earthy tones. I almost get a sourdough bread hint as well.\n\nTaste: Considerable amount of citrus is present with mango dominating along with orange and grapefruit rinds adding in a little pine bitterness and hop bite but not overwhelming. Melon plays a good supporting role and adds some complexity makes it smoother. Earthy-grassy tones are almost non-existent but show up at the very end. \n\nFeel: Haze creates a very smooth mouthfeel without being thick and heavy. A small amount of alcohol warmness considering the 5.8% abv. Perfect amount of carbonation to be refreshing, light, and smooth.\n\nOverall: This beer has a very good flavor and feel and I would certainly buy again. The flavor just feels a bit empty compared to other Toppling Goliath beers I have had, but its very good for the price point and it’s a nice refreshing summer NEIPA.Aug 28, 2021', '4.75Appearance is a hazy pale orange like a fresh squeezed orange juice.

It has notes of peach, tangerine, and a little bit of grapefruit. It smells nice but as the nose approaches the glass it doesn\'t get any stronger.\n\nTaste: Up front there is under-ripe pineapple, grapefruit, and a bit of lime. Towards the middle of the mouth there are more of the same flavors but some bitter lemon flavor comes through. It is a very bright and zesty tasting beer. The aftertaste has the flavor of a light dusting of confectioner\'s sugar.\n\nMouthfeel: It feels on the upper edge of light-bodied with a somewhat crisp finish. There is a bitter bite to the beer akin to grapefruit pulp. It works for this beer.\n\nOverall: The flavor is really where this beer shines, having a bright and welcoming combination of citrus and tropical characters.

Wow. Let's have a taste then. \n\nCertainly this is a tasty one. It's also a well deserved data point in the single hop citra club. I myself brewed two batches of single hop citra beers, one IPA, and one cream ale. Both made my top six list.

Along with these smells comes a rather decent hit of hops, with aromas of herbal and citrus being the most prevalent, but being accompanied by some smells of earth and a floral hop as well. Rounding it all out is a touch of wheat and hay, making a rather nice aroma overall.\nTaste – The taste begins with a flavor of a bready and light cracker malt taste that is matched by some citrus sweetness as well as a tiny bit of harvest fruit and a touch of lemon. At the same time there is a showing of hop, with a herbal and citrus hop being strongest upfront. As the taste advances the sweet citrus seems to grow slightly stronger and is joined by some mango and papaya. The hop also changes over time, initially being mainly of an herbal and citrus nature, but over time taking on some light floral notes as well as a bit of pine. With the flavor transitions that occur throughout, one is left with a rather pleasant and moderately bready taste to linger on the tongue.\nMouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average to slightly lower.

The taste follows the nose; the first thing I notice is the buttery pie crust with fairly sweet, fresh pumpkin puree and lots of spice. I'm tasting nutmeg, allspice, and clove. There is just a hint of hoppiness at the finish. I have to say it's one of the more unique flavors in a Pumpkin Ale. It's fairly effervescent and the 8.6% ABV gives it good substance.

Bright fruit flavors and a decent amount of bitterness backed up by a strong malt foundation. Slightly refreshing and the alcohol isn't discernible at 7.5%. This beer can be dangerous if you put too many back without thinking because it's that drinkable. I go back for a second chug and it is just as refreshing as the first.

This really highlights the traditional style. Very caramel malt forward. No pilsner grain or oats - straight caramel malt, and resinous hops.

I haven\'t smelled an IPA like this in...Well, a long time. It\'s just damn good.\n\nPalate: Instantly, I recognise something about this. Pliny. It hits with a big caramel malt backbone - only slightly sweet, and then this blast of Pacific Northwest resinous hoppy goodness. Pine, resin, some subtle tangerine and grapefruit, and that classic boiled Sincoe note that defines Pliny. The beers are similar. This lacks the insane floral quality of Pliny, and delivers more of that seriously resinous Chinook-type Yakima hop bite, and this is a touch drier. The finish brings a digging bitterness that isn\'t overwhelming, but it damn well shows you what kind of beer it is. That subtle spice note threads through, and then you\'re left with lingering bitter hop oils. Timeless. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: At 7.5% ABV, this is seriously crisp. The sweet caramel malt character is definitely more dialed back than many other WCIPAs, and that slightly drier quality really boosts the drinkability.

Hop oils linger.\n\nOverall: Listen, I\'m not going to pretend like this is the best IPA in the world. It isn\'t. However, in the midst of an overwhelming quantity of hazy, fruity New England IPAs (I style I do enjoy), this just cuts like a knife, and shows you how rare these actually are.

The head had a good diversity of rocky bubbles which had a great retention to it. The beer also leaves a nice lacing around my cup when the head subsided.\n\nI found that the aroma of this beer was very well balanced between the hops, yeast, and malt. Not really overpowering in any particular direction I was able to pick up notes of grapefruit and oranges from the hops, caramel from the malts, banana, cloves and a bit of cinnamon from the yeast.\n\nThe taste follows the nose. Again, similar to the aroma--the word to best describe this beer is 'balance'. I got notes of grapefruit and caramel upfront which then evolved to notes of banana in the middle. While I didn't detect the same level of spiciness that I got from the nose, there was a slight cinnamon note in addition to the banana. The end was where I found more of the malty tastes which contained notes of caramel, bread, and biscuit; these notes were also coupled with the grapefruit bitterness which was initially perceived in the beginning.\n\nThere is definitely a long lingering bitter aftertaste to this beer. I'm not particularly the biggest fan of lingering bitter aftertastes so this was definitely the weakest part of this beer. Despite this bitterness, it wasn't too harsh or overpowering, rather, it was more clean and mellow compared to other IPAs that I've had. This beer was dry, medium bodied and had a moderate amount of carbonation which all contributed to its overall smooth feel and quaff-ability.\n\nOverall, I really like this beer as it's very well balanced and drinkable for the ABV. The bitterness of the grapefruit was a bit too linger for me but other than that I thought that drinking this beer was very enjoyable.

The smell is sweet and fruity that I hesitate to identify as a raspberry. The taste is a perfect combination of fruity sweetness and tartness.

It smells very intensely of fresh raspberries, you can smell it as you pour it it's so strong. The taste is truly incredible. It's like drinking fresh raspberry juice that's slightly tart enough to keep it from being too sweet. It's finely carbonated and perfectly coats your mouth with a very pleasant layer of bubbles.

Served in a Rastal Harmony glass.\xa0\n\nAppearance: The creamy, tightly packed, bone white, one finger head stays around for a while and leaves behind a thin foam ring and lot of thick lacing that covers the entire glass.\n\nSmell: It's a strong, fruity aroma of fresh raspberries and sugary raspberry jam.\n\nTaste: It's a tart, mouthwatering, fruity flavor of pure, fresh raspberries that's just wonderful. A hint of bready pie crust show up in the aftertaste and that's pretty much it. Simple, but pretty much perfectly executed.\n\nMouthfeel: It's quite light but it has substance. Despite the heavy, fruity tartness it never gets cloying. Carbonation is medium low.\n\nOverall: New Glarus can basically do no wrong. This beer is an ode to the humble raspberry.

This brew fully embraces the drinkable and expressive characteristics of its style, with resoundingly positive effects.Mar 05, 2020', '4.5Bottle courtesy of JohnnyHopps. \nLooks like red/pink juice with fluffy carbonation with pink foam. \nTaste and smell predominantly sweet raspberries.

I used to live for that & I was already a home CANning master well before I took HomeEc (Foods) in high school. This was not jelly, not jam, but full-on preserves! Yum. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, not watery, but no great shakes, either. The taste was equally raspberry preserves with a pleasant tartness to cut the potential sweetness. This was the sort of thing that I like to savor on a hot, humid Summer\'s day from a cold ice bath in the cooler. Finish was tart & semi-dry, lingering with the taste of raspberries.

This beer is seriously turbid. Hold it up to the light, and you see swirling plumes if cloudiness. Once the head recedes, it reveals a sparkling surface.\n\nNose: Pungent macerated raspberries. That's exactly what it smells like - a bucket of smashed overripe raspberries, and maybe a hint of Brett, vanilla, oak, butter, and brown sugar. Unbelievably sweet smelling. Fairly simple nose, but an insanely pleasant one. \n\nPalate: Woah! This one will stop you in your tracks for a moment. It smelled unbelievably sweet, because it IS unbelievably sweet. I was expecting a dry pucker.... Nononononno no. This is the filling inside of a raspberry tart. Okay, let's get back to it. The beer greets the palate with a freight train of sweetness. Cane sugar, soda sweetness. Once the palate adjusts, the next things that emerge are deep musty funk, and overripe raspberries. The flavors are intertwined. You get the real, natural, organic raspberry pulp note, and then these musty notes that are almost certainly attributed to brett. There's a whisper of tartness at this point, which slightly increases as the sweetness begins to subside a little, but it's a lightly acidic fruity tart, not a sharp vinegar acetic tart. The tartness, must, and raspberry jam notes persist into the finish, with the funk and tart lifting off, leaving you with a lingering mouthfull of raspberry jam, and some vanilla.\n\nMouthfeel/Body: The beer has a richness about it - a decadence, but,I honestly think that's just from the weight of the sugar in here. The effervescence is very mild, and has a hard time pushing its way through the weight of the beer. I don't detect any alcohol in here, but I can feel its effects, so I'm sure it's over 5. It really drinks like slightly fermented juice. Both in body anf flavor.\n\nOverall: Man, I was not prepared for this one. I was expecting a pucker, and a dryness, and this one smacked me in the face, and then proceeded to make sweet sweet, hot, sticky, passionate love with my palate, and then wanted a cuddle afterwards. Thus beer is sweet. No less sweet than your average fruit juice. I mean sweeeeet. In this particular case, I think it works, because it's all fruit. This is raspberry jam, made with wild raspberries that sat on the bush too long. If you enjoy sweet, and you enjoy raspberry, then this will blow your mind. It's truly a natural raspberry. NOT raspberry flavoring. This is a bowl if sweet ripe raspberries, seeds and all. This is as natural of a taste as you can get. Fermented raspberry juice. THAT'S WHAT IT IS! \nEdit: If you enjoy fermented raspberry juice, then this will blow your mind.Mar 22, 2019"", '4.75Maybe my favorite New Glarus sour.

I can practically picture the juiciness of those cherries as they fall from the tree straight into my beer. Oak and vanilla lend support while softening the beer’s overall sourness. This may be my imagination but I could swear I find hints of leather hiding behind the aromas of oak. Unbaked bread lends itself to the flavors, helping the oak in its bid to soften those flavors of ripe fruit tartness.\nOn the tongue, Rodenbach is smooth and medium bodied. CO2 provides a spritzy carbonation that dances across the tongue. Soft flavors of unbaked bread give a platform for up front tartness which combines deftly with flavors of ripe fruit. Flavors give me ripe cherry as well as red grape minus the tannins. The finish has a lot going on each in its own subtle fashion. Chiefly there’s an earthy quality. Earthiness blends nicely with fruit as well as leather tinted flavors of oak. All of which combines to provide a very gentle flavor profile.\nLike previous Flanders Reds, this one has some great character and great balance. Tartness and flavors of ripe fruit dominate without overpowering. Oak aging and a general bready quality help prevent this beer from being too strong in its tartness.

It gave me back faith in Belgian beer - and since I started trying out a few ones recently, I must admit that all of them have been excellent, just like this Chimay. This one smelled a bit sweet with a kind of fizz, I was expecting some Brett in there but I guess there wasn’t? Although I wouldn’t be surprised if there was because the beer was quite intensely carbonated, very finely carbonated just like a Brett and had a slightly champagne-esque character, although it wasn’t dry. On the contrary, it had a very decent malt presence that made the beer a bit sweet with caramel overtones? Still, overall the beer wasn’t just like a sweet brown ale, it is much more interesting than that. The booze? Maybe. The yeast? Must be. The hops? Well, it must have been an interplay between all of these. It is a very well made beer.

Aromas and flavors are typical of the Belgian yeast profile (e.g. clove, banana), with floral, herbal, and barnyard notes. There is also a slight umami character.

There's a very pleasant malt-hop combination to smell and it likely would be enhanced were the serving closer to room temperature. The taste is malty without being overly sweet and balanced by some earthy hoppiness. The glass lacing completes a very pretty visual. This drinks so much smoother than any adjunct lager it sometimes gets blamed to be among. Taste is a subjective thing, but it astounds that there are advocates that truly believe Budweiser and the others make a superior lager. Perhaps because with a full malt body and an obvious hop finish, this drinks closer to an ale than a lager. There are good ales lighter in body and taste than this.

I found a fresh batch that I wanted to try again and to review so let’s take a look. It has a mild, but respectable 6.0% ABV with 60 IBUs. The name is derived from the “hop belt” which is largely centered around the 48th Parallel and this variety features the Mosaic hops from the Pacific Northwest which give it a distinctive citrus hoppy component. There are several other hops in this variety as well.\n\nLook-I served chilled and fresh into a tall glass and pours a very clear amber color with a reddish copper hue in the right light. The head is one finger thick and frothy which soon settles down into a thin film.\n\nSmell-It has a bready malt backbone freckled with noticeable citrus hops which come through nicely. \n\nTaste-It has the same nice bready malt flavor that the nose picked up, but also had a noticeable honey overtone to it as well. You all know how nicely honey plays with citrus so this is delicious. That was a pleasant surprise. Then I get orange zest, lemon peel, tangerine, and some grassy hops that show up later on with the delayed release of carbonation which dances simultaneously with the hops. The alcohol is mild and bites the citrus at the end. \n\nMouthfeel-It has a smooth medium-bodied feel with a delayed release of the respectable levels of carbonation. It leaves a lingering, but fine-tuned coating on the tongue composed of the hop resins and a slight citrus tinge from the hops.\n\nOverall-Lending to the presence of the Mosiac hops, I recognize a mild West Coast Style IPA aspect to this brew. It is crisp, finishes clean, and is not too hoppy. Although I am a hop head, it is nice sometimes for something more realistic and mild for those long rainy days.

OK, now for the taste, the big category. Unfortunately, nothing to rave about here. It's pretty good; well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone, which is more earthy than sweet (good) and a hoppy finish. The body is a little thin and the hops aren't bitter enough, but they're there. If ever there was an IPA intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers, this is it.

A pale SRM colour pours the same hue when swished and poured again. Lively head, steady presentation with an overall lighter than expected appearance as mentioned before. \n\nSmall citrus notes, mainly notes of the grains of paradise pepper in the scent. Similar to the scent the taste gives a lot of attention to the spicy pepper notes, alongside a bit of a citrus tang in the rears with a main presentation of the wheat malt; that's, a great thing thing btw. Very Americanized wheat beer, I believe it is more flavourful than 312 from Goose Island and more complex than Bell's Oberon, though the spicy notes might turn away some drinkers. \n\nAs expected high drinkability because of the wheat malt blends. Bit of a soapy mouthfeel from the oils, but nothing too unappealing.May 29, 2021"", '4I have been drinking these since they were released this year in 2021. It is a refreshing beer that has a nice accent point on citrus fruit and wheat. A great example of an American wheat beer with from the look, smell and taste. Seems like they went with a more neutral yeast not giving strong bananas or clove flavors leaving the flavor to be driven by the malts, adjuncts and the spices added.\nThe look is a hazy gold beer with lots of carbonation when poured into a glass from a bottle. The smell is fruity with the main scents of citrus based fruits. The mouthfeel is a low medium to medium and pleasant while also being refreshing. The taste is mostly general citrus and a hint of malt which quickly disappears after swallowed leaving you wanting another sip. Overall for a seasonal beer this one hits the spot for a spring beer transitioning to a summer beer with plenty of nice flavor and also being refreshing to down a few.May 29, 2021', '3.5Had one from its own can and my housemates took the other 2. Punchy lemon and tangerine are at the forefront backed up by wheat. There is a spiciness to it that I assume comes from the grains of paradise that are described. The overall taste is more robust than the Porch Rocker, another Sam Adams summer ""lawnmower beer"" brewed with lemon. While the two serve the same purpose, the Summer Ale is the more memorable of the two. A light body with medium carbonation make it easy enough to drink, though it may be on the thin side.May 22, 2021', '3.5Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Weizen Glass\n\nPours hazy orange/straw color, with a small foamy head that recedes fairly quickly, no lacing. \n\nMild aroma, mainly lemon and wheat, with some mild orange/tangerine undertones.

During the summer this is one of my top beers. The lemon is very apparent and it makes for one of the best grilling beers available. I’ve had this during colder days and it doesn’t give me nearly the satisfaction. I’d highly recommend for outdoor social events as this is essentially summer in a glass.Apr 09, 2021', ""4.5Appearance: Pours a cloudy, medium-deep orange color with a mild and crispy head that fades. SRM of 10. (4.00)\n\nAroma: Very unique aroma. Tangerine, lemon peel, and wheat. But then an overpowering spicy, aroma that I can't place, but reminds me of rye or Jasmine and cracked pepper. Maybe some mint and lime with hints of tomato or cumin. Unique and quite nice. (4.25)\n\nFlavor: Flavor follows the nose with lemon and grains upfront that is followed by the strong spicy lemon & lime, white pepper and spice flavor from the African Grains of paradise. It ends with a nice grainy malts and yeast. A light noble hop grassiness on the back end too. The spice gives the citrus and drying flavor that is unique in that it is not bitter. Nice complex flavor profile. Tastes like a fancy tangerine spice soap. A little it of the lemon/lime Gatorade flavor here too. (4.50)\n\nFeel: Mouthfeel is light, but not too light. Crispy, spicy, and peppery on the tongue, but finishes with a perfect amount of honey sweetness. Overall, finishes spicy and mildly sweet. It does the mouthfeel well. (4.5)\n\nCompared to Sam Adams Boston Lager 8/2/20: Pours a lighter color. More citrus and wheat on the nose. Both have a nice spice component, but the Boston Lager is heaver and sweeter. \n\nCompared to Castle Danger's Summer Crush 5/30/21: Pours a darker, clearer color. More orange, spice, mint, and wheat. Less lemon cream. \n\nto Bells' Oberon 6/6/21: Pours similar. More citrus, lime, mint, pepper, and spice. Stronger wheat flavor. Less sweet orange malt. Finishes hoppier and less smooth. \n\nto Stone Dayfall 7/3/21: Pours a similar color with the same amount of cloudiness. Milder aroma. More lemon citrus, pepper, spice, and grain malt. Less orange, flower, and bergamot. \n\nto 3 Floyd's Gumballhead 7/25/21: Pours a slightly lighter color. More lemon citrus, white pepper, spice, and flowery notes. Less tangerine and gummy bear. Slightly less sweet. \n\nto New Belgium Summer Bliss 8/1/21: Pours a darker and clearer color. More lemon/lime citrus and peppery spice. Less mango, guava, wheat, coconut, and overall fruitiness. A larger and more wheat body. Very similar though. Winner: Sam Adams\n\nOverall (4.5): Now this is a unique and well-crafted summer ale. The lemon and lime dance nicely with the spice pepper and grains. It even has a lemon/lime Gatorade flavor which is unique. The African Grains of Paradise create a perfect kick that a pale wheat needs. It's extremely well-rounded and not one aspect is overpowering. The spice is quite nice here. Difficult to characterize the African Grains of I think often the pale wheat style can be quite bland, and this is so much better than others I've had.

People on here have described this as similar to Blue Moon, but I would think that Blue Moon would drink far superior. This was bland, sour, and flavorless.

That being said, one of the best homemade shandys I’ve ever crafted was with Shock. 1/4th Newman’s Lemonade and 3/4th a glass of Shock and damn you got a good mix. But, if you’re beer needs Newman’s help to be considered good, you don’t have a very good beer.

At the time, I was underwhelmed but perhaps now that I have acquired more beer knowledge, I can more fairly evaluate it. Poured into short cylindrical glass from glass bottle.\n\nL: SRM about 7, deep gold to pale amber. A short lived flimsy head forms and the liquid is noticeably cloudy. An unfiltered style, sediments visible in glass. \n\nS: Gentle orange and lime with a malt backbone. Not much going on here, the nose is extremely passive, as if the scents want to remain in the glass.\n\nT: A very mellow citrus of orange and lime upfront, carried by a stronger coriander, that is wrapped up at the end by weak malt (stale bread). Like the nose, the palate desires more.\n\nF: Rather flat, nearly no bitterness at 10ibu and carbonation only a litter stronger. I suppose that explains the subtly of flavors. Smooth, but that is all.\n\nOverall, the Belgian White is brewed to be easy drinking. For those who want a refreshing beer that leaves nothing to contemplate. It actually tastes like it was left opened in a garage for a day and then bottled. The flavors are pleasant, just not nearly strong enough, lacking any bite on the tongue or chew on the finish.

Today Shock Top is sold in the same pint cans sizes as a blue moon, though typically priced higher for the same style of product. \n\nWhat blue moon lacks in orange flavor, Shock Top delivers on. Pouring a simple hazy unfiltered atypical orange with mildly aggressive head, zero lacings, and a lot of carbonation. \n\nSmelling notes include orange, coriander, and carbon dissipation. \n\nThe taste is of sugar orange spice with a heavy mouthfeel. You will feel like you're chewing a piece of oat. Not too sure if. it matters but this AB beverage uses brewers syrup (big whoop) and gives this a syrupy texture.

Aroma is smoking, which is strange, but done well. It smells like you're walking into a smoking BBQ joint. Other notes in the aroma include roasted and toasted malts and cocoa nibs. The flavor profile is dark, with roasted and toasted malts under a billow of smoky notes. A little accent of chocolate and cocoa nibs helps this beer round out well.

The nose is a great blend of smoke, vanilla, roast, coffee, cocoa and a mild hop character. The smoke is a little wet and fruity. The palate opens smoky before a blend of vanilla, cocoa, coffee grounds and a mild fruitiness (cherry wood? apple?) . The roasted malt flavor is heavier on the coffee grounds/chicory flavors. Drying, roasty and with a little cocoa on the finish, this beer is light in body, moderately carbonated and has a nice finish. Quite excellent, i like this more than the variants Stone came up with way back when.Jul 10, 2016', '4.5This classic smoked porter pours a pitch black color with a small to moderate tan head. The smell is fairly malty and smoky, though not as smoky as say a rauchbier. There is a very nice, solid, but not at all overwhelming smoke flavor that combines well with the molasses and dark chocolate flavors of the malts. This is a pretty full bodied porter, which I am definitely into, but it is still smooth and has a nice clean finish. The finish is slightly bitter, which enhances the dark chocolate flavor. This is an excellent smoked porter and it upholds the high standards of Stone as much as any of their other beers in my opinion. This kind of robust porter isn’t for everyone, but personally I think it is one of the best at least as far as the smoked variety goes.Jun 12, 2016', '4I read a thread on BA that this one was going to be retired. I then noticed it by chance at Outlet Liquors in Rehoboth, DE sometime in May. Although the enjoy by date was listed as 2/29, I nevertheless bought it with the idea that I might see it again. I finally got around to drinking it tonight. Wish I could try it ""fresh"", however, I still though it was good.\nIt poured a dark brown and mahogany with a nice fluffy and foamy head. The lace is patchy, ring like, frothy and sticky. A good looking brew.\nThe aroma reminds me mostly of sweet chocolate, roasted malt and light coffee. Some of this sweetness is felt in the tongue but only vaguely, as a moderate but bold bitterness predominates. This bitterness comes from an espresso, burnt malts and assertive hops presence. The smoky quality is mostly felt in the finish and leaves a dry and bitter aftertaste. This one grows on you by the sip. As it warms, it mellows out a bit.\nThe mouthfeel is fluffy, creamy, velvety and smooth. Full in the mouth but not quite robust, just enough to be drinkable. \nI hope to find this one again and if possible, find a fresher version to compare.Jun 04, 2016', ""4.5Amazing complex. Not like anything I've ever had before. Stout black with a light lacey head that disappears pretty quickly. The smell is very subtle considering how flavor packed it is. On my first taste I was blown away by how smoky it was, but by my 3rd taste I could hardly taste it anymore. Deliciously malty with relatively subtle hops.

Would definitely have again.May 23, 2016"", ""3I was hoping for much more in the way of Porter flavor. This one came through rather limp-wristed and I am a bit disappointed.

A finger of very loud, fizzy white head aggressively settles down to a boiling cap in a matter or moments. Thousands of straying bubbles course upwards keeping the surface alive and dancing.\n\nNose is a touch of pilsner-like malt, that immediately shifts to this wonderful bouquet of tart lemon, barnyard funk, buttery oak, hay, white wine barrel, a touch of acetic zing, and some musty brett. It's wonderfully complex and surprising.\n\nPalate is one of the most confusing ales I've tasted. There's just so much going on, it's hard to pin one thing down. I get that pilsner-esque malt character first, but then a big grassy note takes over. After the grass and hay, I get the lightest bit of tartness. To my relief, it's more of a lactic tart, and not like vinegar. But it's very subtle. A little.bit of lemon zest, a good bit of white vinous character, some oak, some serious funk that I just can't begin to describe - it's so familiar - it reminds me of something outside of the world of beer, but I cannot place it. There's also some herbal notes that remind me of cooking herbs, like oregano, cilantro, or maybe some spices. Basil, perhaps. That familiar funk peeks in and out, and then Brett comes in and washes everything but oaky vanillin away, leaving and light, dusty bitterness. After a long, complex finish, the faint ghost of the malt comes back, and lingers quietly.\n\nMouthfeel is fairly light in body, but there's a slight creaminess about it. Lively, fizzy, loose carbonation keeps everything exciting and aids in the flavor complexity.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic take on a saison. It's really more of a saison/wild ale hybrid, but hey, there's still a lot of saison character there. A good saison is one of my favorite beers, but the last 5 or so I've had have just been awful pilsners. This, however, has given me hope once again.

I am in the midst of a purge of The Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody & I ran across a buncha GI beers, including this one. I am moonlighting in addition to my day gig so I haven\'t had a lot of drinking time upon returning home, hence the lagging, NOT lollygagging. \n\nFrom the Bottle: ""90% Belgian Style Ale blended with 10% Belgian Style Ale aged in Wine Barrels with Orange Peels""; ""Develops in the bottle over 5 years.

I generally strive for clarity from my pours in my beers, but this style can be ""poor to good though haze is not unexpected"". Hmm. I decided on a compromise - my initial pour would be very slow & gentle with an eye towards keeping the lees in place. My second pour would follow an in-bottle swirl to release the lees back into suspension for a waste not, want not pour. I Pop!ped the cap & began the initial pour, followed by an in-glass swirl to attempt to raise some head. This trick worked wonders & I wound up with just under two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention that left behind some decent lacing. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with the NE-quality clarity that I was striving for. Nose was at one very vinous and very barnyard funky. My guess would be white wine barrels & the funk was leathery & sweaty, like a saddle off a freshly-ridden camel. You thought that I was going to say ""horse"", didn\'t you? We rode camels in Hurghada, Egypt & man, can they work up a sweat! Thankfully, the vinousness outstripped the sweatiness in this one. Phew. Mouthfeel was light, soft, almost like a spritzer than a beer. The taste was only lightly funky, begging the question of how much of that characteristic it may have taken on over 5 years\' time. On the other hand, it was quite vinous, but I also tasted a light orange citrusiness. Finish was dry, of course, but not so dry as to be unpleasant. Saisons were originally developed to be refreshing interludes for farm workers & this was certainly refreshing, And now, for the latter, second pour: I had replaced the cap following the initial pour so as not to allow the beer\'s CO2 to simply escape. I agitated the beer in the bottle nearly constantly as I drank to ensure that I would achieve the desired effect (or die trying). Never say ""die"", you say? A coward dies a thousand deaths, a soldier dies but one! We must be bold in this day & age of beer, never cowardly! The color turned much more hazy & the nose & taste became slightly more pronounced, but overall, it did not change very much.

I can pick out some dark fruit aromas like bing cherries, raisins, prunes, and figs. Surprisingly, I am not getting a lot of coffee on the aroma. Baker\'s chocolate, amaretto, and a touch of acidity.

Coffee certainly comes through in the taste up front. There is a bit of acidity up front that works well overall. The mouthfeel is nice - very smooth. The finish is decadent unsweetened chocolate. The flavors linger long and leave a rich feeling on the palate, even though the beer is very dry. There is also a sharp bitterness on the finish that leads me to think that the bitterness is coming from hops more than it is coming from roasted malts or coffee. The 12% ABV is hidden very well. And it\'s interesting that while the coffee flavor is pronounced, the coffee does not overpower the other flavors in the beer.\n\nFeel: The mouthfeel is lovely - very smooth. I was expecting the mouthfeel to be a bit thicker based on others\' reviews. Nonetheless, it has a very nice mouthfeel.\n\nOverall: I haven\'t had this beer in a long time.

To me, this has the character of an imperial stout, which then had coffee added to it as the label says ""Imperial Stout with Coffee""...not ""Imperial Coffee Stout.""

This beer is another one that has been on my radar to try for a while now. The beer is 42 degrees and served in a tulip glass. I am going to warm this beer up just a touch more before consuming it. The beer emits a nice hiss as I popped the top. The pour of the beer created a lovely two-fingered head with average retention. The bright white head is creamy and airy leaving some lacing as it slowly dissipated. The color of the beer is SRM 6, pale gold with amber hues. The beer is clear with some carbonation bubble dancing lazily within. I would have liked to see a longer-lasting head. Overall the appearance of the beer is an average plus. \n\nInitial aromas in the beer are straw, lightly toasted malts, and subtle sour lemons. Nosing further I detect, earthiness, floral, salty air, lightly toasted bread crust, and a touch of herbal. Interestingly, I do not get any funky aromas but just the faint whiff of sourness. \n\nThe flavors in the beer are grass, cereal grains, lightly toasted malts, lemons, a touch of herbal, and a smidge of floral esters.\n\nThe mouthfeel of the beer is creamy, smooth, and crisp. \n\nThe body of the beer is medium-light, medium carbonation, and light finish. \n\nI would not consider this beer a farmhouse ale it taste like a cream ale with a hint of hops.

No fruit here, but maybe there's traces of lemon or farmhouse yeast. (4.00)\n\nFeel: Medium-bodied, but almost feels like it's lighter than it is because it is so soft on the palate.

The flavors are big and bold but well balanced. Its mouth feel is moderate in thickness and carbonation and the 8.7% ABV gives it good substance. It doesn't drink like a big beer but you have to pace yourself. Overall, this is one of the best Black IPAs I've had the pleasure to drink.

It's not overly pronounced but enough that I'm not enjoying this one. Still refreshing, but too many better choices out there to go back to this one.Jul 04, 2021"", '4.25I currently live in a Deep South rural hollow that has a liquor store and a Wal-Mart, so I don\'t get much of a selection, although thankfully, Hoegaarden, my global go-to beer, is available! Being a fan of Leiny\'s Vanilla Porter (which used to be Creme Stout) ever since doing a half-year-long gig in Wisconsin years ago, I decided to try this Summer Shandy. I\'m a fan of fruity wheat bears like (where can I get it now?) Sam Adam\'s Blackberry Wit that get it right, so I decided to try this; I was not disappointed. In fact, now that the oppressive summer heat is in full swing with triple-digit heat index conditions, I find this beer irresistible; its essence is perfectly in tune with my loud A/C. Perhaps I have just needed a change of pace from the Hoegaarden, which I drink all the time, any season, any continent.\n\nYes, it\'s a bit light on the wheat part, but it\'s still there, and of good quality. Yes, there lemon is strong, but isn\'t an American wheat beer supposed to have lemon slice or two (or three) in it? I was bit leery of trying a beer that seeks to be strong in citrus, as I remember trying a Berliner Tart (perhaps also a Leiny?) that I had found painful, but this Summer Shandy nails it at just the right level of tart & sweetness while still feeling like ""beer"". Can\'t decide between lemonade & beer? This is the answer that splits it down the middle!\n\nTo the beer snobs that have to have an IPA, go elsewhere with your bitter brew. Is there a better representative of this style? Sure, get me a Boulevard ZŌN with some lemon slices; I haven\'t been able to find that since the summer years ago that I spent in southern Illinois. OTOH, Summer Shandy can be found at any major grocer anywhere in the USA. What are you going to do? In my fridge, Summer Shandy is next door to Sam Adam\'s Summer Ale (also easily available locally, and I am a huge fan of SA\'s Winter Ale), but I keep reaching for the Shandy.Jun 15, 2021', '3.5Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (~90% opacity), light pale lemon color with a moderate white head. SRM of 6. (4.00)\n\nAroma: Strong aromas of lemon citrus, sweet candied lemon, lemonade, and some lemon pound cake underneath.

(3.50)\n\nCompared to Fulton Blonde 6/8/21: Pours a lighter color. A stronger lemon aroma. Less honey and malt body. Lighter and cleaner\n\nOverall: Pretty much what I expected for a lemon shandy here. Strong lemonade and lemon shandy flavors. Not bad for a light, fruity, and crisp alcoholic beverage. Notice I said ""alcoholic beverage"" and not beer. Not sure I would classify this as a beer. I think it drinks closer to a cider, cocktail, or mimosa, you decide. Nevertheless, it\'s a tasty offering from Leinenkugal. Is it surprising that this is the first drink I like from them and it is the one that is furthest from a beer? Maybe Leinenkugal should stick to things besides beer, because the more they try and make it a beer, the less I seem to like it. This may be their best ""beverage"" I\'ve tried.

Well, suppose you overdid it by an extra gallon or three and that’s what this smells like.\n\nFeel:\nPerhaps its only redeemable attribute. Its light body bathes in a soothing, sea-foam of carbonation that ends with a polite, citrus linger. Shockingly balanced.\n\nTaste:\nThe day I was given this shandy, I had a customer who was looking for it. When I guided him to it, he asked convivially, “Ever had this one before?” I told him I hadn’t, that I preferred stouts and porters. He scrunched his nose like I’d sprayed him with skunk pee instead of answering his question, “But those are dark and thick!” he scolded.\n\nIn an attempt to avoid alienating the customer, I told him I also liked IPAs too. The effort backfired as the man recoiled and beheld me in abject horror, eyes widening, as though he’d just discovered I were a cross burning, devil smooching, apostate. “But IPAs are bitter as hell. This is light!” With that, he scrambled to the safety of the unopinionated cashier before any more of my heretical sermon could blaze pentagrams into his poor, virgin soul.\n\nAt the end of the day, I looked at this shandy and realized: This beer was the go-to beer for a man who despises actual beer. And by consciously pouring it into a glass, I was consenting to imbibe some revolting shit. \n\nWhile I’m pleased to tell you it isn’t revolting, I can tell you that 14 out of its 16 ounces were used to clean my garbage disposal today. The sink now shares the same emaciated, wheat-and-lemon grass character that mimics the palate of this shandy, steel sink included.\n\nOverall:\nA drink for people who actually want White Claw, but are too emasculated at the thought of having to look another human in the eye as they purchase hard seltzer.Jun 18, 2020', ""4.25leinenkugel summer shandy is a decent beer and feels like a dick in my mouth. although to some, this may seem like a bad thing, but for me it was quite good. i also thoroughly enjoy the way it is overall. it smells like a normal beer, so i gave it a 2. i even added decimal points to show my experience in the field and that i am capable of distinguishing the vast array of alcohol brands i have tried. as a result, Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy is a decent overall beer and i would recommend it is tried while trying to game with the boys.Jun 11, 2020"", '3.5A ""I kind of want a beer, but lemonade, but not too sweet"" kind of drink, suited for warmer weather.

The aroma was what I had been craving. I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate.

First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it\'d pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas.

Some cork rot is visible.\n\nPours a clear ruddy deep reddish copper-brown hue, topped woth a finger of coarse pinkish-brown head that quickly reduces to a thin collar, fed by streams of effervescence climbing the glass walls. \n\nNose: Absolutely stunning right from the start. Bold, intense aromas of lightly toasted grains bringing a gentle caramel sweetness, big musty cherry that has begun to lose its battle with age, warm, fruity red wine notes, with just enough oxidation to lend some sherry and brandy characteristics, and a panoply of stewed dark fruits. There is a present, but balanced brettanomyces influence, lending the perfect amount of musty funk, forest floor, dusty cellar, petrichor, and this sort of morning-on-the-lake aroma. and it's all held together by a splintery oaken halo, which provides some leather, varnish, and old parchment. Beautiful.\n\nPalate: Supplication greets the palate drier than the aroma would lead one to believe. The grain peeks through just a touch, with a hint of dustiness, while the cherries, with all their sugars fermented out step up with big funky, mushy skin and pit notes. Interestingly, the wine character lacks all fruitiness, and reveals itself with dry, tannic, soaked cask notes. As it opens up, a plummy dark fruit note emerges midpalate. Acidity is mild to moderate, with a quick twinge upfront, and quickly extinguished by the dry, tannic, splintery white oak. There's plenty of musty, dusty brett funk, reminiscent of overripe apricot pits, but there's also this subtle earthy, almost mold-like funk that may very well be from cork rot. The finish is exceedingly dry, with plentiful woody oak. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: The ale is light to medium-bodied, bright, snappy, and exceedingly crisp for nearly 8% ABV. The grains to lend some soft texture, and the fruit addition, while dry, does lend additional body. Effervescence is lively, zippy, and foams up over the palate. Tannic and drying. \n\nOverall: This is a very nice, classic fruited wild ale. I love the jammy stuff as much as the next person, but there's something beautifully rustic and raw about these ones. Every ounce of sugar has been fermented out, leaving a seriously musty, funky, fermented cherry flavour, relying on that touch of grain to give it body. The funk is very earthy, but plays well with the cherry, and the wine translates as mature, funky, wet oak - and lots of it. The subtle plummy notes are tasteful, and it all comes together to show the ale's depth and character.

I got big notes of acetic acid upfront along with a nice funk from the brett, both were coupled with prominent notes of oak and pinot. The sourness mellowed a bit towards the middle and end, where the beer showcased more of its sweet/tart cherry notes in the middle, followed by a slight but noticeable bready malt character in the finish. Truly a nice balance between the flavors of the cherries, barrel, and brett/lacto/pedio.\n\nThis beer was medium bodied and had a medium amount of carbonation to it.

It is very drinkable for as tart as it is (for my tastes at least) and has the subtle, near-constant, tongue-corner-mouth-watering-tickle-thing going on that makes beers like this a non-stop experience when drinking them, as its residue lingers and evolves in your mouth between sips.

Had to manually reduce the head, but it appeared to have great retention. Zero lacing though. Lots of effervescence in a nucleated glass. \n\nNose: Lots of wheat and estery notes typical of a weizen. Soft malted wheat, a bit of toasted brown bread, and a round nutty note. The yeast lends some pink bubblegum, unripe banana, a hint of allspice, white pepper, some earthy, spicy hop notes, and even just the slightest whisper of funk. A hint of dark fruit wafting in and out. Smells very typical of the style. \n\nPalate: The beer greets the palate with sweet malted wheat and a big bloom of esters, very much in line with the aroma. The esters deliver big bubblegum, unripe banana, and spice notes. The alcohol also has nowhere to hide, so even though it\'s only 8.2% ABV, there is a defined boozy note. There isn\'t exactly a chocolate note, but the slight toastiness wants to go in that direction. Almost like white chocolate with just a kiss of cocoa. The malty sweetness quickly falls back, upping the drier roasty character a little bit, which also reveals some mild spicy hops. Together, this forms a restrained bitterness, and in addition to the yeast esters, some more phenolic notes show up, lending a bit of spiciness. All of these traits work together to give this beer a finish that isn\'t too dissimilar from a Belgian quadruple, minus the sweetness and much of the complexity. Ultimately finishes dry. \n\nMouthfeel/Body: The beer is essentially medium-bodied, but there\'s a fullness to it that seems to increase in heft as it progresses, bringing this closer to medium-full in body. It definitely has a creaminess to it, and it\'s quite soft. It isn\'t particularly sticky or sappy, but between the wheat base, the ABV, and the soft effervescence, it takes on a full, creamy softness, much like a stout of the same ABV would be. \n\nOverall: I\'ve heard that this is one of the msot respected examples of the style. It\'s certainly authentic, and there\'s something about these traditional German ""bock"" beers that are nearly impossible for American breweries to accurately replicate. For that it is, it ticks all the boxes, and seems to have everything going for it. Now, with that said, I have two primary knocks. First, the yeast esters are a bit overbearing in my opinion. The pink bubblegum note becomes a bit one-dimensional after a while, and I wish that were toned down a notch. Second, is the boozy note. While this isn\'t as distracting as the bubblegum note, while drinking this, I am constantly aware of the alcohol flavour. Perhaps the style just doesn\'t lend itself to hiding ABV that well, in which case a lower ABV format might suit it better, but then you\'d lose that wonderful body. It is a bit boozy, but I guess the trade off is that it\'s delightfully silky smooth.

Initially detected a sweet citrus (tangerine) aroma. Apparent oak tannins on the nose.\n\nT: Carbonic bite followed by golden raisin, citrus and lactic acidity. The acidity is not as sharp as I had assumed from the aroma - its actually far more restrained and well balanced, like a sparkling moscato or chardonnay. \n\nM: The combination of high carbonation and tannins create a full mouthfeel despite the thin body. Some lingering silkiness, perhaps owing to soft water (pure speculation).\n\nO: Very well rounded flavor profile and balanced body.

More dry Brett funk, citrus rind, pineapple, and tart juicy fruit near the end. Ultimately finishes dry with the French oak tannins and more stone fruit.\n\nM: A light body and low alcohol flavors. The carbonation sensation is a touch on the low side but not so much as to detract.\n\nO: Very good. The oak was a worry for me – I don’t always appreciate the French oak flavors. But everything plays so nicely with each other here – balanced, nuanced, and complex. Not overly vinous, not overly funky. While I don’t think there’s apricots or peaches in here, that dry flavor pulls through with the citric acid and lemons and adds quite a bit to the flavor profile.

Has a very carbonated looking, white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that eventually settles to a thick, creamy looking, layer of surface foam along with a very thick ring of foam surrounding the inside of the glass. Good lacing here too. Aromas of some bready malts, yeasty esters, and Chardonnay oak along with some Brettanomyces funk notes that's all rounded out with just a hint of lactose. Flavor wise, this starts out with some bready malt that gives way to oaked Chardonnay white wine grape that has a nice tartness upfront that gives way to some yeasty funk and sourness, both from the grape and also from what seems to be some lactose as well as far as my tastebuds are concerned. All the flavors are balanced and compliment each other superbly. WOW!!! Has fairly crisp, also smooth, dry mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Also has a dry finish and aftertaste, and the sour funk really coats the inside of my mouth and my tongue nicely after each sip and lingers for quite awhile after each sip.

There's roasted malt, tannins, hops, alcohol and even some chocolate. The body is amazingly rich and smooth, especially considering all that it's delivering. There is sufficient glass lacing to bear witness to the quality of this brew's body. This may be a little too much for those that like a less whiskey influenced ale, even though the tannins are pretty well balanced by the other tastes.

Smells just like a holiday fruitcake. Not detecting the typical notes found in lambics however.\n\nT - A cornucopia of flavors intermingling. It's very hard to nail down individual ones. The typical fresh tartness and earthiness of the kriek yeast are dominant on the palate. It's sweet but not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe. Fruitcake in a glass would be a fair comparison. Cinnamon spices and brown sugar mix expertly with the cherries. There is a slight medicinal quality that a bit off-putting, possibly from the high gravity. Some may like that, but I don't. Thankfully it doesn't mar the experience too much.\n\nF - This is a big boy. Each sip of this syrupy brew is like a bite of food. Very heavy body, carbonation level is medium but suitable for this.

Strong alcohol scent the further you get into it.\nTaste: There\'s a pronounced sweetness, but in a different way than I expected. It\'s more malted sweetness dominated than fruity sweetness dominated, so it\'s more representative of raisin than cherry when tasting. Definitely, spices push through as well.

Although the bottle itself is maybe a pregame to a pregame.\nFeel: It\'s got a nice, gentler carbonation on the mouth, but is certainly present.

The yeast contributes greatly to the flavor. Some overly ripened banana. A touch of woody bitterness in the middle and on the finish.

But, he said, there was one place in the city he knew of that carried some bottles. ""Where?"" A block down the street. I bought the last two on the shelf.\n\nTry and find it.Jan 20, 2021', ""4.5335ml bottle - 20.12.20 (so exactly 3 years old) - poured into a Chimay goblet at 40°F, allowed to warm.\n\n2020 Christmas bottle #2\n\nThanks Bobby.\n\nPours an opaque, muddy maroon-mahogany brown, topped with two fingers of foamy beige head with some dark cinnamon swirling, and remarkable retention, and a collar composed of massive bubbles, fed by plentiful streams of effervescence. A few small floaties are visible. \n\nNose: This is a very difficult aroma to describe, because it's so unique and unusual, and unlike any quad I've had. Incredibly nutty and complex - sweet toasty malts with notes of brown bread, concord grape, fresh and dried figs, raisins, dates, prunes, with baking spice notes of nutmeg, allspice, and candied ginger. Some molasses, brown sugar, and distinct leather, and some bright fruity red apple and pomegranate cutting through. It's a truly remarkable aroma. \n\nPalate: Westvleteren 12 greets the palate fairly dry for a quad, opening with fresh dark bread, a big nutty maltiness, and a bright fruity element that reminds me of cognac - fresh red apple, red grape, raisin, plums, figs, and persimmons. These fruit notes become darker and more like dried fruits, with prune, date, and raisin, before this incredibly exotic malt note appears - leather, vanilla bean, age, old wood, Irish whiskey, caramel, almond, toffee, and nougat, yet still decidedly dry. A herbal bitterness begins to develop, perhaps just a whisper of licorice, with gentian root, bitter herbs, grass, and a distinctly German hop spicy leafy note, with a moderately bitter resinous bite. This hoppiness lingers for ages, with whispers of everything that came before it slowly fading in and out, finally finishing with a unique earthy flavour. \n\nMedium-bodied, with no stickiness at all. Both Rochefort 10 and (especially) St. Bernardus are fuller, heavier, and stickier. The dryness here allows it to be supremely drinkable, with a nice presence, but never fights back. Beautifully lively and fine effervescence lends plenty of lift and cuts right through that 1.2% ABV. Hearty, fluid, wholesome, quenching, bold, crisp, malty and dry.\n\nOverall: In a word? Beautiful. This is a beautiful beer, with an incomparable malt profile, a unique bright fruitiness, crisp dryness, and intriguing complexity. It reminds me a lot of old cognac, and the malt base has similarities to classical English barleywines. I can see why this one is so revered. Between Rochefort, Bernardus, and this, this is probably the most enjoyable (to me), followed by Bernardus, and then Rochefort. It feels masterful and dialed in - like the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I'm privileged and grateful to have enjoyed this one, and I think it is worthy of its accolades. Enjoy this one with food if you can. Enjoy the experience - take notes, review later.Dec 27, 2020"", '5Been cellaring this one for a few years now and felt like this holiday was an appropriate time to bring it out.

Getting to try this certainly is a big beer milestone for me. Poured into a goblet glass, this beer pours a dark ruby color with some bright ruby/amber highlights when held up to the light. Has a just slightly off-white/tan head that's about half an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with a film layer of surface foam. Aromas of toasted, bready, caramel malts followed by dried fig, plum, yeasty esters, a hint of cocoa, a bit of leather, and hint of sweet , Red Delicious apple. Tastewise, the flavor profile is very similar, with the aforementioned toasted, caramel, bready malts along with plums, figs and just a hint of Red Delicious apple. This is followed by some Belgian Candy sugars along with a bit of yeastiness and just a hint of cocoa and leather here too. The flavor profile does change and get a bit more complex as the beer sits and warms up. Just an absolutely fantastic flavor profile. Has a smooth, fairly frothy, slightly creamy, also still somewhat crisp, medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish, and all the flavors stack around on the inside of my mouth on my palate for awhile after each sip. WOW!

Picking up on the abv more as it warms, but it adds some depth. \n\nMy recollection of other quads is fuzzy, but from what I do remeber the richness/juiciness of the dark fruit notes distinguishes this from other of the style. Like other trappist quads, this is incredibly well balanced. What impressed me is that the balance leans slightly toward the dark fruit notes without becoming overly sweet/cloying.

In fact, this is the best beer I have ever tasted. I agree with most of the previous favourable comments re its taste, smell, mouthfeel and absurdly quaffable nature (particularly given the 10.2% ABV) but I would also like to add that I completely agree with those who recommend a 12-16 degree (celsius) drinking temperature. This means you take one out of your cupboard/safe/bank vault and put it in the fridge for only 15-20 minutes...the complexity really comes through at this temperature.

Must be a good price for a beer that has a 100/100 rating here. I'm very excited to try it as it's my first Trappist ale. Poured out into a clean snifter, light golden as it poured and darkening as it collected in the bottom of the glass. Nice inch of flaxen head that sticks around in a fluffy layer floating on top. Scent reminds me of banana and raisins predominantly and maybe some orange and grapefruit too. As i swirl the glass, the head foams up again robustly. Upon the first sip, I'm not as terribly impressed as i expected to be. Strong malt backbone, candies of butterscotch and sugary burnt bananas predominate. Also raisins, dates, figs. But it's also somewhat bitter with an earthy, musty type taste to it. Somewhat leathery. The 11% is well hidden and doesn't come through too strongly. Comes with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full, well rounded, and highly carbonated. Overall it's a pretty good brew, but won't receive my highest marks. It's perhaps that I'm not trying several beers of this style in a row to pick the best. Perhaps my palate is still young and inexperienced. But regardless of what others say, I have to decide for myself. i tend to like big, heavy, thick, dense beers, with robust abvs, and maybe i was expecting the taste of a stout or porter.

Rather malty, with malted milk, bread crust, caramel, toffee, and toast, with secondary notes of Dutch cocoa, coffee and cream. It's quite nutty, perhaps with a hint of hazelnut, and then underlying notes of raisin and fig emerge. There is a hop presence to this, which lends some spicy, floral, and earthy notes in the background, with just a quiet whisper of bitterness. The ale finishes with bread crust, caramel, cocoa powder, and those spicy hops.\n\nMouthfeel/Body This quadruple drinks with a medium-full body, while retaining a surprising crispness, with not nearly the weight a stout or barleywine with the same ABV would have. The rich malt is balanced by a crisp dryness that prevents the ale from being sticky or sweet. Effervescence is quite lively and fine.

I'm sure all the top tier quads are great, and this is no exception, but I find it lacks the nuance and complexity of Bernardus. It is itself a great quad, and it finds wonderful balance between rich nutty malt and crisp dryness, while showcasing some lovely trappist influence, and for sheer drinkable, this may be the best.

Although it wasn’t exactly a straight line to get from there to here, when I tried out Trappist beers from Belgium, I knew that this was something that I’ve been looking for and everything else must have originated from this style.\nThe presence of Brett is very obvious when you look at the beer, all that lively carbonation tells you that it isn’t artifical and that it is something special. And the aroma is just stunning! The Brett, the hops, the malts... just sniffing into it I knew I was home. I knew that this is an amazing beer.\nAnd it sure is. It is so very overwhelming, even at the first sip. Brett, hops, sweet malty body with tickling, champagne-esque carbonation, mingled together in such a unique way you just simply can’t get enough of. Topped with that 8% ABV, kind of plush booziness, wraps up the whole thing in perfection, makes it something outstanding and peerless out of this beer.\nThis might very easily be a go-to beer for me from now.

First time I recall it being snappy grassy crisp, this is malty and carries some of the flavor notes you’d associate with a Belgian quad but riding on a lighter less carmelized format. I neglected to put carefully and have a constellation of sediment in this chalice, perhaps that lends some doughy body to what I previously considered a snappy tripel.

It is time to right that wrong today! I do not like a triple that is overbearing, yeasty, and malty, yet many I have consumed lean this way. I have a hard time discerning what is the perfect balance. This beer is eight months old. This is newer than what I have consumed in the past. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a chalice. A lively head, but average retention. The massive three-fingered bubbly, airy, and creamy bright white head left some lacing on the glass as it dissipated. The head dropped two finger lengths but maintained for a moment. I wanted the head to stay massive and leave an abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale gold with amber yellow hues. The beer is somewhat cloudy with active carbonation. The appearance of the beer is average for this style. \n\nThe initial aromas in the beer are banana, cloves, spicy phenols, and lightly toasted malts. Nosing further, I detect a floral bouquet, toasty bread, oranges, a touch herbal, a subtle fruity sweetness. \n\nThe flavors in the beer are oranges, peppery, cloves, banana esters, phenolic, herbal, honey-like sweetness, lightly toasted malts, crackers, perfumey hops, and floral undertone. \n\nThe mouthfeel of the beer is slightly warming with a high effervescent. \n\nThe body of the beer is medium, medium-high carbonation, and fuller finish. \n\nI enjoy how beer starts off subtle, then slowly builds in flavor, and then a spicy peppery clove finish. The flavors of the beer are bright and contrasting. The malt in the beer is not overpowering but provides a firm backbone for this beer. I am honestly surprised by this beer. The beer is an excellent example of what a triple should be, disappointed I kept passing it up.Apr 30, 2021', '4.2511.2 oz.

Head is rocky, bone white, and lasting.\nOn initial examination Westmalle Tripel's aroma is fragrant and perfumey in nature. Fruit esters are what I notice next. Specifically, I can smell ripe, juicy orange combined with hints of ripe pear. All this combines with what I can only describe as banana coupled with honey, fresh from the comb. Then comes this gentle spicy, peppery quality typical of so many great Belgian ales. What's impressive is how each aroma adds to a complex, delicious smelling aroma giving Westmalle Tripel an aroma that is complex, and delicate.\nWestmalle Tripel's body is smooth, crisp, delicate, and lightly carbonated. The flavors follow the nose well except I do notice the presence of malt more here than I did on the nose. Those malt flavors start you off delicately grainy before moving into gentle alcoholic spiciness coupled with flavors of honey and ripe fruit esters. As with the nose those esters come out in the form of orange juice, pear, and banana following behind and lending support. The finish is peppery, dry, and lasting.\nits easy to see why Westmalle Tripel is one of the world's great examples of the style. It's nothing short of delicious.

Ideal consumption within 6 months - this was packaged on 09/08/2020, consumption was well within the freshness period - all information on hops and freshness acquired from Allagashs site. \n\nMy final verdict when comparing this to Hoegaarden, UFO, or even Blue Moon is that the hoppiness alongside the well-balanced flavors of Belgian yeast notes and noble/ American hop blends delivers a highly drinkable, full-flavored 'Belgian-style' beer that is one of the best you can buy. My only drawbacks are that authentic Belgian witbier has never been brewed with orange flavoring. Keith Villa and Belly Slide Wit (now Blue Moon) originated this flavor trend that has repetitively been copied from many different breweries starting in the mid-90s. Originally Hoegaarden was what inspired Vila, a nearly unknown dying village beer brought back to life while Vila studied at their brewery, which helped bring the beer stateside. The addition of the valencia orange was a marketing gimmick Villa 'bottlecap' his signature beer with. Not only did the orange give onlookers in the pub a reason to ask what that 'hazy' beer was (need to remember gen public didn't really understand hazy beer) but it helped to add a signature look unlike any other beer likely poured up in most American Bars. Though some of my research suggests Allagash was almost the first brewery in the US to add orange flavoring to Belgian-style wit's conversely, I don't know who influenced what outside of Hoegaarden for US brewers. I feel this is a better take on the beer style, but truly inauthentic.Dec 17, 2020"", '3From the bottom of the can: ""PACKAGED 10-07-20 09:31:6771""\n\nAppearance: The beer is a very pale dry straw color, almost to the point of being grey.

Excellent head retention. \n\nAroma: There is a light lemon peel aroma.\n\nTaste: Up front there is a tangerine flavor mixed with pepper. Towards the middle of the mouth there is a bit of papaya flavor. The aftertaste has a bit of bubblegum character and a slightly bitter herb note that is nondescript.\n\nMouthfeel: Carbonation is good and it is easy to drink. It feels light-bodied and wet.\n\nOverall: The can states that this is a ""Beer with Coriander & Curaçao Orange Peel."" The Coriander character is missing from the beer, as is any wheat flavor. The yeast character is minimal. The orange peel flavor is outstanding. The beer as a whole is decent and I could drink it from time to time, but there are better ones on the market with more flavor and aroma.Dec 05, 2020', ""4.75Note the date--I am writing this after a scrumptious Thanksgiving meal. The beer that went along with it: Allagash White. One of the yellowest and hazy wheat beers I've had, this Allagash White came out of the bottle with a nice thick head. The initial smell was pleasant, but the light citrus taste really puts it home. Moreover, the wheatiness and yeastiness remain without making the beer too heavy. This is one of the easiest beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. One note: you should follow the instructions on the bottle and rouse the yeast out at the bottom. I forgot to do that the second time around and the final tastes were not as good. Otherwise, I commend Allagash for their superior brewmanship.Nov 27, 2020"", ""4.75This has to be one of the best easy-drinking beers there is.

The beer is 40 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish tint with good retention. I was not expecting much retention in the head of the beer, this is a fruit beer. The beer having some retention is impressive, I have seen similar styles fall flat quickly. The head did not leave any lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is a dark reddish hue with a dark copper hue. This beer is clear, considering this is a fruit beer. I was expecting some sediment or something. It does not distract from the appearance. The overall appearance is above average. \n\nThe initial aromas in the beer are cherries, sugar syrup, and lightly toasted malts. Nosing further, I detect oak, malty sweetness, a touch of herbal, grassy, and a hint of floral. The aromas are cherry dominant, it is hard for me to pull any other aromas out. \n\nThe flavors in the beer are cherries, malts, grass, lightly toasted malts, oak, wheat, a note of earth, floral esters, a hint of phenols, and a note of pharmaceutical. \n\nThe mouthfeel is slightly tart and dry. \n\nThe body of the beer is medium, medium-light carbonation, and full finish. \n\nIs this a beer? It is simply one awesome beer. The fruit flavors are bright and vibrant. The malt and wheat are subtle but there and the oak finishes the beer perfectly.

It's sweeter than I was anticipating, almost sickly so, and I think sweeter than I'd like. \n\nThankfully it's not quite as sweet tasting as it smells. I think my mis-expectations were driven by the 'belgian red' aspect of the name, so I was thinking something significantly more sour. There's a definite tartness to the taste, but even then I wouldn't call it sour, and it doesn't match up with my limited experience with belgian reds (flanders style). But I am drilling into the wrong things here. \nThe flavour is a pleasant blend of the sweetness from the cherries and a nice tart finish that actually has elements of tart cherries/tart cherry juice, which I enjoy quite a bit. Also a lot of 'red' flavour a la fruit punch, but again, thankfully not as cloyingly sweet.\n\nAs stated, it's got some tart acidity, and some bright effervescence, but is otherwise very smoothe. \n\nThis is a masterfully put together beer. I can see why it gets the love it does. It doesn't happen to match straight up with my personal preferences, especially when it comes to cherries (and primarily on the nose), but I can see why people love it, and it is undeniably very well put together.\n\nMuch gratitude to @FBarber for sending this along my way during NBW BIF #13!

A little swirling brings and eruption of additional velvety foam that compliments the liquid beautifully. Gorgeous and extremely inviting.\n\nAroma profile like I've never experienced before. Midwest cherry-heavy, with distinct sugar, vanilla, and pastry notes that give it a wonderful cherry pie persona up front. Floral hops, cracked wheat, freshly-cut oak, and just a touch of dank grass. There's also a slight cinnamon note (or some other baking spice?), which gives it a warm apple cider vibe on the back end. Perhaps that's simply the cherry pie reflection playing tricks on me. Regardless, the nose is incredibly delicate and nuanced, even with the cherry dominance. Really amazing.\n\nNo surprises on the tongue, as the cherry juice (which isn't sugary sweet or sour in any way, but a highly appealing, natural juice flavor), oak barrel, barley, Belgian spice, and cidery notes wash over the tongue blissfully. It's initially sweet, but that sweetness falls off quite quickly and provides a faint, lasting tartness and tang. I wouldn't call it dry, but the sweetness is lovely and fits the rest of the beer perfectly. So well executed. It doesn't scream beer by any means, but it's not one-note and overly sweet like a cider. And I can see the wine reference by the brewer, as fermented fruit is clearly the star of the show, but there are honest grain and hop notes that pull it back into the middle.

I rarely drink the same beer multiple times in a sitting anymore, but I could sip on this all day.\n\nFeel is medium-thin, soft, well carbonated, and incredibly easy to drink.\n\nTruly remarkable beer.

He had a 6-pack at one of his parties and I ended up drinking almost the whole thing. It immediately became one of my favorite beers. I love that it\'s hoppy, but not so much so that the malt can\'t compete, and that the rye shows clearly; and looking at what I\'ve got in front of me, given that it\'s well over a year old, it\'s surprisingly hoppy - I could smell the hops when I opened the bottle. Anyway, I\'m not sure when this was discontinued but I haven\'t been able to find it - I\'m sure there are fresher bottles around, in fact this one from Total Wine & More was probably bottled before the ones that I got from my friend! I bought it anyway, despite the price, because I like it that much; and to be honest, upon tasting it now the malt has held up extremely nicely as well. There\'s a touch of oxidation there, sure, but it\'s not bad, I\'m still enjoying it. All of the dark chocolate is there, the softer fudge-like and caramel notes, the roastiness, the spice from the rye, and the pine and citrus from the hops - and if there\'s one thing that\'s missing it\'s that the citrus seems to have waned a little. Oh man, I\'m going to miss this one. Hopefully I\'ll come across some that\'s been discounted and I can buy up the lot. I said before that if the new Leo v. Ursus beers were all as good as the Forte it would be worth it to discontinue some others, but sitting here with one in my hand I doubt that.

It's a very dark red with a demonic ring of fizz in the middle that, I swear to god, looks like the ring from the movie The Ring.\n\nThe aroma is intense. I can smell thick, sour barley from two feet away. Taking a proper snort, the aroma becomes surprisingly thick, like Hershey's syrup and booze.\n\nAge has treated this wonderfully. It's still weird, but not especially rough. The flavor nodes proceed as clear stages without any cohesion, like different parts of a cream-based salad that have curdled and separated throughout the years. Bitter barley moves into milk chocolate, which moves into soy sauce, which finishes on brown sugar and whiskey burn. \n\nOverall... I dunno. I recall paying a price for this that seemed ridiculous in 2008 but was probably about what I pay for a 16 ounce can of mediocre IPA in 2020.

The peppers and cinnamon provide just a touch of lingering heat, and the chocolate gives you a bit of unsweetened bitterness. This is really a wonderful beer - strong competition for Prairie\'s Christmas Bomb.\n\nMouthfeel toes the line between medium and full bodied, which is a perfect compliment to the flavor profile.

Hard to pick up the vanilla on the nose, but it could easily be blending in with the chocolate and other aromas. After drinking, I can pick up on a vanilla cream note in the nose on the front end that is reminiscent of cream soda, very nice. Gives some nutty roasted almond notes too that are quite nice. A mild earthy hop aroma and acidity on the finish as well. This smells like Mexican hot chocolate and it smells delicious!\n\nTaste: Wow, this is a lot sweeter than I expected. It at least has a perceived sweetness initially. It's very smooth and drinkable. This is a dangerous beer at 8.1% ABV. The flavors in this beer meld together very nicely; to me they are more discernible on the nose than in the mouth. Up front, you get spiced coffee/hot chocolate notes and sweetness that quickly transition to a roasty, slightly bitter finish with a lingering spicy chili pepper. The finish has really nice unsweetened chocolate notes, along with some fruitiness from the chocolate and pasilla pepper. The finish has a lot of sweetness also; you can tell your brain what you want to focus on - bitter or sweet. I get a lot of spiced nut notes on the finish as well.\n\nFeel: Mouthfeel is really nice - on the thicker side of medium body. Slightly chewy and pefectly carbonated for this type of beer.\n\nOverall: A really delicious adjunct stout. Is this a pastry stout?

I’ll have to say, I feel like I forgot what a pale ale is supposed to taste or smell like these last 5 or so years. This one has an aroma of pine, herbal tea notes, and some orange notes. The taste is right in line, balanced with a firm malt backbone. The feel is medium, carbonation is medium. Overall, one of the better pale ales I have had in a while that didn’t pretend to be a hazy IPA.Thursday at 08:25 PM', ""4.5Pretty amber color, not red, not yellow but amber.

Less stonefruit and spiced caramelized malts. Lighter flavors and more citrus overall. \n\nOverall: An top shelf beer. This one has strong orange, pine, bitterness with a sweet malt profile. I was initially blown away by the citrus hop flavors and pine bitterness, yet it has such a strong malt balance to counteract that. It's the perfect balanced pale ale here and I'm not sure whether it finishes bitter or sweet. I think that's what makes it finish so well and would rate this pale ale as a top not because of that.

Low lace upon a finished glass.\n\nSmell - Floral and seems to be loaded to the brim with Mosaic I remember so fondly before the juice bomb phase of beer decided to rear its head.\n\nTaste - Straight floral with some grapefruit goodness.\n\nFeel - Right here is where I feel this beer really shines through. This is probably the smoothest pale/ipa I have ever had in my near decade of drinking the crafts, Goes down silky smooth. Almost like water but the body isn't watery. Does that make sense? Probably not but you get it...maybe. No I'm serious. I've almost finished the glass and didn't even notice. LOW bitterness even if it sits. Seriously. How did FFF manage to achieve this smoothness? It doesn't even seem real.\n\nOverall - While I do not feel the flavors live up to the legendary status, This is ABSOLUTELY the smoothest pale/ipa you are ever going to find anywhere. This will impress new craft drinkers and the seasoned veteran all the same. $13.99 in my opinion is a bit stiff for a sixer, But If you want something flavorful that you can throw back in a pinch without any of the cloying sweetness and or bitterness that some of these brews can eventually take on, This is your guy.Aug 14, 2021"", '4.5Pours a half clear orange color with a medium bodied off white colored head that laces the glass a lot as it fades.

Less of a palate smasher than expected. Medium bodied, lighter feeling than it looks, perfect amount of carbonation. Excellent Pale ale, almost to the IPA side but really well done.Aug 07, 2021', '5I first tried Zombie Dust when a friend brought it to my house about 6 years ago. His daughter went to college in Indiana and brought it home for him. Wow. This beer really turned me onto IPAs. I was lucky enough to get another 6 pack of Zombie Dust last week and I am savoring every sip. Really really great.Aug 04, 2021', '4This is one of those ""must try,"" beers to my knowledge, so I figured its worth reviewing. \n\nLook: Pretty standard, but certainly hazier than I was expecting. Good lacing though. \n\nSmell: This is where it starts to lose me a little. Now it smells fine and all, but for a Pale Ale, it\'s simply way too hoppy. I almost thought I had gotten the style wrong when I smelled it. \n\nTaste: Again, this is not a Pale Ale. It\'s clearly an IPA with the level of hops going on here. There is almost no focus on bringing the malts up front, which is really what distinguishes the two styles for me. PAs can be hoppy, even very hoppy, but they need to also give attention to the forward malt flavor. This beer only has a semblance of that. I guess it\'s more present than a typical IPA, but hardly so, and I would bet any beer drinker would label it an IPA if you gave it to them blind. The taste isn\'t even bad, but to be honest it\'s a pretty standard fruity west coast style. Nothing special either; hops aren\'t particularly unique or interesting. As it starts to warm a bit the malt comes in, but right out of the can it\'s almost completely absent.\n\nFeel: I find it has a bit more success here. It isn\'t quite as heavy as a typical IPA, likely thanks to the slightly lower ABV. On the other hand, it\'s still far too heavy for a PA. \n\nOverall: I like this beer. However, it simply doesn\'t work as a Pale Ale for me. There are plenty of hoppy PA\'s I\'ve had that find that still manage to keep the malt characteristic of a PA; this is not one of them. Again, it\'s too heavy as well. Either this beer should be labeled an IPA, or brought down to something like 5.5% and given more malt focus. I don\'t know why some breweries have these baffling mislabeled beers sometimes, it puts a huge stain on what would otherwise be a fine beer. The fact that this has the #1 spot for Pale Ales shows how biased some of the reviewers on this site are towards IPAs. It feels like it has that spot because it\'s an IPA competing with Pale Ales, almost like an 8th grader competing in the little leagues. \n\nRegardless, even if this *were* just called an IPA, I still don\'t think it would be the 40th best beer in the world which is what this site seems to contend. Not sure where the obsession with this beer came from, maybe it\'s something before my time. Also, a 6 pack of this is like 14 bucks when there are plenty of $11 six packs I\'d say are way better.Jul 29, 2021', ""4.25Can Date: 4/8/21\nPalate Contaminants: none\n\nHere's hoping this hasn't been hanging around the store or on a truck too long.\n\nNice dark gold color, slightly opaque.

Some pine needles are in there, but the balance of having it mostly fruit is favorable. Light orange, maybe shading a little toward lime.\n\nFruit up front, but that quickly gives way to earthiness in the back. I don't know that I could say pineapple is the fruit, so much as nondescript citrus. Moderate sweetness, moderate-heavy bitterness. Decidedly malty. Lots of cut grass, tree bark, and moss. It doesn't lean toward pine as much as some other brews.\n\nNice moderate weight. Very well integrated carbonation. Woodsy aftertaste. It's really smooth drinking, too.

I read the reviews on BeerAdvocate before buying it and was really impressed with its 100 and world class rating! I checked the canned-on date and found it was only 3 weeks old! I poured into a Teku glass (that my brother got me!) to enhance the aroma with the laser-etched nucleation sites on the bottom. \n\nLook-It pours a beautiful orange-gold color like viscous honey in the winter. I see hues of cedar and magenta in the light. The head is thin and puffy white with an effervescent quality leading to thin and persistent droopy lacing on the glass. It has a slight haziness, likely due to all the zombies that they grinded up and put into this world-class brew (lol). \n\nSmell-It has a remarkably rich aroma. I smell tropical fruits, citrus, honey, and half-baked bread. I get strong notes of tropical pith and skins such as overripe papaya skins, apricot, pineapple, and mango rind. I also get white pepper, green tea leaves, grapefruit, cracked rye, tobacco and pine.\n\nTaste-One of the most pleasant things about this beer is its clean flavor. There are no sticky, cloying, or syrupy malty flavors and/or textures. It is rich in tropical fruits, pine, citrus, and breaded malts. The citrus, pine, and mild sweetness from the toasty, bready malts hit first and then a piney hop resin takes over in the most wonderful manner. The slight bitterness lingers, and the effervescent pop mingles with it tickling your tongue. I sense a pithy texture on my tongue from the more prominent tropical fruit qualities of the hops. It has a medium-body and very smooth quality. \n\nOverall-This beer has one of those rare professional qualities to it that you cannot quite put your finger on. It is well-balanced, delicious, juicy, nuanced, and complex. I agree with the overall rating of it at this time as a world-class brew. It is impressive for another reason. It is a pale ale, but drinks a bit like a west coast IPA! I am glad to have found this so fresh and suddenly. It definitely lives up to all the hype! Drink this one brain-dead or while eating brains!

Just pure clean pleasant hop aroma.\n\nT: Grapefruit and piney hops balanced perfectly with just enough bready malt sweetness. Bitterness lingers a little in the aftertaste, perhaps a little too long.\n\nF: Medium-full bodied; very smooth.\n\nO: Lives up to the hype.May 08, 2021']",20,24,11,58,37,43,0,62,84,5,20
